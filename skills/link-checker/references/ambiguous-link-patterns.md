# Link Checker reference: Ambiguous Link Patterns

Part of the `link-checker` skill. Read this only when the task reaches these sections.

## Ambiguous Link Patterns

### Flagged as Violations

These link texts are always ambiguous and must be rewritten:

| Ambiguous Text | Problem | Better Alternative |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| "Click here" | Action-focused, not purpose-focused | "Download the annual report" |
| "Here" | No purpose at all | "View our pricing plans" |
| "Read more" | More about what? | "Read more about our accessibility policy" |
| "Learn more" | Learn more about what? | "Learn more about WCAG 2.2 changes" |
| "More" | More what? | "More articles about web accessibility" |
| "More info" | Info about what? | "More info about screen reader support" |
| "Link" | Describes the element, not the destination | "Annual accessibility audit results" |
| "Details" | Details about what? | "Details about the January release" |
| "Info" | Info about what? | "Information about our return policy" |
| "Go" | Go where? | "Go to account settings" |
| "See more" | See more of what? | "See more customer reviews" |
| "Continue" | Continue to what? | "Continue to payment" |
| "Start" | Start what? | "Start your free trial" |
| "Submit" | For links (not form buttons) | "Submit your application" |
| "Download" | Download what? | "Download the 2025 annual report (PDF, 2.4 MB)" |
| "View" | View what? | "View your order history" |
| "Open" | Open what? | "Open the accessibility settings" |
| URL as text | URLs are not descriptive | "Visit the W3C accessibility guidelines" |

### Flagged as Warnings

These patterns are context-dependent and may or may not be accessible:

- **"Read more" inside a card/article** -- Acceptable ONLY if `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` provides the full context
- **"View details" in a table row** -- Acceptable ONLY if `aria-label` includes the row context (e.g., `aria-label="View details for Order #1234"`)
- **Icon-only links** -- Acceptable ONLY if `aria-label` is present and descriptive

## Detection Rules

### Rule 1: Exact Match on Known Ambiguous Strings

Flag any link whose **visible text content** (trimmed, case-insensitive) exactly matches one of the ambiguous patterns listed above.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: Exact match on "click here" -->
<a href="/pricing">Click here</a>

<!-- FLAGGED: Exact match on "read more" -->
<a href="/blog/post-1">Read more</a>

<!-- NOT FLAGGED: Descriptive text -->
<a href="/pricing">View our pricing plans</a>
```

### Rule 2: Starts With Ambiguous Prefix

Flag any link whose text starts with an ambiguous prefix followed by minimal content.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: Starts with "click here" -->
<a href="/report">Click here to download</a>

<!-- BETTER: Purpose-first -->
<a href="/report">Download the 2025 annual report</a>
```

### Rule 3: Repeated Identical Link Text

Flag when multiple links on the same page have identical text but point to different destinations.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: Three "Read more" links going to different pages -->
<a href="/blog/post-1">Read more</a>
<a href="/blog/post-2">Read more</a>
<a href="/blog/post-3">Read more</a>

<!-- FIXED: Each link is unique -->
<a href="/blog/post-1">Read more about accessible forms</a>
<a href="/blog/post-2">Read more about ARIA best practices</a>
<a href="/blog/post-3">Read more about focus management</a>

<!-- ALSO ACCEPTABLE: Using aria-label for uniqueness -->
<a href="/blog/post-1" aria-label="Read more about accessible forms">Read more</a>
<a href="/blog/post-2" aria-label="Read more about ARIA best practices">Read more</a>
<a href="/blog/post-3" aria-label="Read more about focus management">Read more</a>
```

### Rule 4: URL as Link Text

Flag links where the visible text is a URL.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: URL is not descriptive -->
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/</a>

<!-- FIXED: Descriptive text with URL available -->
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2 specification</a>
```

### Rule 5: Adjacent Duplicate Links

Flag when an image and a text link sit next to each other and go to the same destination. These should be combined into a single link.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: Two separate links to the same destination -->
<a href="/product/123"><img src="widget.jpg" alt="Widget Pro"></a>
<a href="/product/123">Widget Pro</a>

<!-- FIXED: Single combined link -->
<a href="/product/123">
  <img src="widget.jpg" alt="">
  Widget Pro
</a>
```

### Rule 6: Links Opening in New Windows

Flag links that open in a new window/tab without warning the user.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: No indication of new window -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Example Site</a>

<!-- FIXED: User is warned -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Example Site (opens in new tab)
</a>

<!-- ALSO ACCEPTABLE: Using aria-label or visually hidden text -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
   aria-label="Example Site (opens in new tab)">
  Example Site
  <span class="visually-hidden">(opens in new tab)</span>
</a>
```

### Rule 7: Links to Non-HTML Resources

Flag links to PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, or other non-HTML resources that do not indicate the file type.

```html
<!-- FLAGGED: No indication this is a PDF -->
<a href="/reports/annual-2025.pdf">Annual Report</a>

<!-- FIXED: File type and size indicated -->
<a href="/reports/annual-2025.pdf">Annual Report 2025 (PDF, 2.4 MB)</a>
```

## Fixing Ambiguous Links

### Strategy 1: Rewrite the Link Text

The simplest and best approach. Make the link text describe the destination or action.

```html
<!-- Before -->
<p>To learn about our services, <a href="/services">click here</a>.</p>

<!-- After -->
<p><a href="/services">Learn about our services</a>.</p>
```

### Strategy 2: Use aria-label for Context

When you cannot change the visible text (e.g., design constraints), use `aria-label` to provide the full context to screen readers.

```html
<!-- Visible text is short, aria-label provides context -->
<article>
  <h3>Accessible Forms Guide</h3>
  <p>Learn how to build forms that work for everyone...</p>
  <a href="/guides/forms" aria-label="Read more about accessible forms">Read more</a>
</article>
```

**Important:** `aria-label` completely replaces the visible text for screen readers. Ensure the `aria-label` includes the visible text to maintain consistency (WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name).

### Strategy 3: Use aria-labelledby for Composed Labels

When the link purpose comes from a combination of elements:

```html
<article>
  <h3 id="post-title">Accessible Forms Guide</h3>
  <p>Learn how to build forms that work for everyone...</p>
  <a href="/guides/forms" aria-labelledby="post-title read-more-1">
    <span id="read-more-1">Read more</span>
  </a>
</article>
```

### Strategy 4: Use Visually Hidden Text

Add context that is hidden visually but read by screen readers:

```html
<a href="/guides/forms">
  Read more<span class="visually-hidden"> about accessible forms</span>
</a>
```

CSS for visually hidden:

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border: 0;
}
```
