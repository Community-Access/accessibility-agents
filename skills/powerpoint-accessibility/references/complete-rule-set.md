# PowerPoint Accessibility reference: Complete Rule Set

Part of the `powerpoint-accessibility` skill. Read this only when the task reaches these sections.

## Complete Rule Set

### Errors - Blocking accessibility issues

Each rule ID, with name and what it checks.

| Rule ID | Name | What It Checks |
|---------|------|----------------|
| PPTX-E001 | missing-alt-text | Images, shapes, SmartArt, charts, icons, and embedded objects without alt text. In Open XML, check `<p:cNvPr>` elements for missing or empty `descr` attribute in slide XML. |
| PPTX-E002 | missing-slide-title | Slides without a title placeholder. Check for `<p:sp>` with `<p:ph type="title"/>` or `<p:ph type="ctrTitle"/>` in `<p:nvSpPr>`. Title must contain non-empty text. |
| PPTX-E003 | duplicate-slide-title | Multiple slides with identical title text. Screen reader users navigate by slide title - duplicates make it impossible to distinguish slides. |
| PPTX-E004 | missing-table-header | Tables without header row designation. In Open XML, check for `<a:tbl>` with `firstRow="1"` in `<a:tblPr>`. |
| PPTX-E005 | ambiguous-link-text | Hyperlinks with non-descriptive text ("click here", "here", raw URLs). Check `<a:hlinkClick>` and associated text runs. |
| PPTX-E006 | reading-order | Content reading order not explicitly set or in an illogical sequence. The order of `<p:sp>` elements in `<p:spTree>` determines reading order - it must match the intended visual flow. |
| PPTX-E007 | presentation-access-restricted | Presentation has Information Rights Management (IRM) restrictions that prevent assistive technology from reading content. Screen readers cannot access IRM-protected presentations. |

### Warnings - Moderate accessibility issues

Each rule ID, with name and what it checks.

| Rule ID | Name | What It Checks |
|---------|------|----------------|
| PPTX-W001 | missing-presentation-title | Presentation title not set in `docProps/core.xml`. Screen readers announce this when opening the file. |
| PPTX-W002 | layout-table | Tables used for visual layout instead of tabular data. Tables should only be used for data that has meaningful row/column relationships. |
| PPTX-W003 | merged-table-cells | Tables with merged cells that break screen reader grid navigation. Check for `<a:tc gridSpan="...">` or `<a:tc rowSpan="...">` in table XML. |
| PPTX-W004 | missing-captions | Audio or video content without captions or transcript indication. Check for `<p:vid>` or `<a:audioFile>` elements. |
| PPTX-W005 | color-only-meaning | Content where color is the sole way to convey meaning (e.g., "items in red are overdue"). |
| PPTX-W006 | long-alt-text | Alt text exceeding 150 characters. |

### Tips - Best practices

Each rule ID, with name and what it checks.

| Rule ID | Name | What It Checks |
|---------|------|----------------|
| PPTX-T001 | missing-section-names | Presentation sections without meaningful names, or no sections at all in long presentations (>10 slides). |
| PPTX-T002 | excessive-animations | Slides with many animations or auto-advancing transitions that may disorient screen reader users or users with vestibular disorders. |
| PPTX-T003 | missing-slide-notes | Slides without speaker notes. Notes can serve as a caption/transcript fallback for spoken presentations. |
| PPTX-T004 | missing-presentation-language | Presentation language not set in `docProps/core.xml`. |

## Rule Details and Remediation

### PPTX-E001: Missing Alt Text

**Impact:** Blind users skip over images entirely or hear "image" with no description. The visual content is completely lost.

**Open XML location:** In slide XML (`ppt/slides/slideN.xml`):

```xml
<p:cNvPr id="4" name="Picture 3" descr="Team photo from the 2025 company retreat"/>
```

Missing or empty `descr` is a violation. Also check:

- `<pic:cNvPr>` for pictures
- Shape `<p:cNvPr>` for shapes and SmartArt
- Chart frames for charts

**Remediation:**

1. Right-click the image -> Edit Alt Text
2. Describe the content and purpose of the image
3. For decorative images (borders, backgrounds), check "Mark as decorative" (the scanner detects the Office decorative flag and skips these)
4. Charts: summarize the key data insight, not just "chart"

### PPTX-E002: Missing Slide Title

**Impact:** Screen reader users navigate presentations by slide title. A slide without a title is unlabeled - like a chapter without a name.

**Open XML location:** In slide XML, look for the title placeholder:

```xml
<p:nvSpPr>
  <p:cNvPr id="2" name="Title 1"/>
  <p:cNvSpPr>
    <a:spLocks noGrp="1"/>
  </p:cNvSpPr>
  <p:nvPr>
    <p:ph type="title"/>
  </p:nvPr>
</p:nvSpPr>
```

The title shape must exist AND contain non-empty text in its `<a:t>` elements.

**Remediation:**

1. If the slide layout has a title placeholder: click it and type a descriptive title
2. If the layout lacks a title: Insert -> Text Box -> add title text, then in Selection Pane rename it to include "Title"
3. Or switch to a layout that includes a title placeholder
4. If a visible title doesn't fit the design: add a title placeholder and set it off-screen or use the slide's accessible name

### PPTX-E003: Duplicate Slide Title

**Impact:** When multiple slides share the same title, screen reader users have no way to distinguish them in the navigation list.

**Remediation:**

1. Append a differentiator: "Q3 Results - Revenue", "Q3 Results - Expenses"
2. Or number them: "Key Findings (1 of 3)", "Key Findings (2 of 3)"

### PPTX-E004: Missing Table Header

**Impact:** Screen readers announce cell values without column context. "2.1 million" means nothing without the header "Revenue".

**Open XML location:** In slide XML, tables use:

```xml
<a:tblPr firstRow="1" bandRow="1">
```

`firstRow="1"` indicates the first row is a header row.

**Remediation:**

1. Select the table -> Table Design tab -> check "Header Row"
2. Ensure first-row cells contain descriptive column headers

### PPTX-E005: Ambiguous Link Text

**Impact:** Same as DOCX-E006. Screen reader link lists become a wall of "click here".

**Remediation:**

1. Right-click hyperlink -> Edit Hyperlink -> Text to Display
2. Write text that describes the destination

### PPTX-E006: Reading Order

**Impact:** Screen readers read slide content in the order elements appear in the XML tree (`<p:spTree>`). If this doesn't match the visual flow, content is announced in wrong order - conclusions before evidence, data before labels.

**Open XML location:** The order of `<p:sp>` elements in `<p:spTree>` determines reading order. The first `<p:sp>` is read first by screen readers.

**Remediation:**

1. View tab -> Selection Pane (or Home -> Arrange -> Selection Pane)
2. Items are listed bottom-to-top (bottom item is read FIRST by screen reader)
3. Drag items to reorder: title first, then content top-to-bottom, left-to-right
4. Check every slide - adding/moving objects changes reading order
