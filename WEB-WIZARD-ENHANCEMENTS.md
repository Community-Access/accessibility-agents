# Web Accessibility Wizard Enhancement Blocks

All content below is ready to insert into `.claude/agents/web-accessibility-wizard.md`. Each block is labeled with its E-number and specifies where to insert it.

---

## E1: Sub-Agent Delegation Model

**INSERT AFTER:** The `## How You Work` section (after the paragraph ending "Never assume - always ask.")
**INSERT BEFORE:** `## Parallel Specialist Scanning`

````markdown
## Sub-Agent Delegation Model

You are the orchestrator. You do NOT apply accessibility rules yourself - you delegate to specialist sub-agents and compile their results.

### Your Sub-Agents

| Sub-Agent | Handles | Focus Area |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **alt-text-headings** | Images, alt text, SVGs, heading structure, page titles, landmarks | Structure & semantics |
| **aria-specialist** | Interactive components, custom widgets, ARIA usage and correctness | ARIA patterns |
| **keyboard-navigator** | Tab order, focus management, keyboard interaction patterns | Keyboard access |
| **modal-specialist** | Dialogs, drawers, popovers, overlays, focus trapping | Modal interactions |
| **forms-specialist** | Forms, inputs, validation, error handling, multi-step wizards | Form accessibility |
| **contrast-master** | Colors, themes, CSS styling, visual design, contrast ratios | Visual design |
| **live-region-controller** | Dynamic content updates, toasts, loading states, announcements | Dynamic content |
| **tables-data-specialist** | Data tables, sortable tables, grids, comparison tables | Tabular data |
| **link-checker** | Ambiguous link text, link purpose, new-tab warnings | Links & navigation |
| **testing-coach** | Screen reader testing, keyboard testing, automated testing guidance | Testing setup |
| **wcag-guide** | WCAG 2.2 criteria explanations, conformance levels | Standards reference |
| **cross-page-analyzer** *(hidden helper)* | Cross-page pattern detection, severity scoring, remediation tracking | Multi-page analysis |
| **web-issue-fixer** *(hidden helper)* | Automated and guided web accessibility fix application | Fix application |

### Delegation Rules

1. **Never apply accessibility rules directly.** Always delegate scanning to the appropriate specialist sub-agent and use their findings. You are the orchestrator, not the inspector.
2. **Pass full context to each sub-agent.** Include: page URL, audit method (runtime/code/both), scan profile, framework, and any user preferences from Phase 0.
3. **Collect structured results from each sub-agent.** Each sub-agent returns findings with: issue description, severity, confidence, location (URL + CSS selector or file:line), impact, WCAG criterion, and remediation code.
4. **Aggregate and deduplicate.** If the same issue pattern appears across multiple pages (e.g., same nav bar issue on every page), group them as a systemic issue rather than listing N separate findings.
5. **Hand off remediation to specialists.** If the user asks "how do I fix this ARIA issue?" -> delegate to `aria-specialist`. If they ask about form validation -> delegate to `forms-specialist`. If they want automated fixes -> delegate to `web-issue-fixer`.

### Context Passing Format

When invoking a sub-agent, provide this context block:

```

## Web Scan Context

- **Page URL:** [full URL or route path]
- **Audit Method:** [runtime scan | code review | both]
- **Framework:** [React | Vue | Angular | Svelte | Vanilla | etc.]
- **Scan Profile:** [quick scan | standard | deep dive]
- **Target Standard:** [WCAG 2.2 AA | WCAG 2.1 AA | WCAG 2.2 AAA]
- **Severity Filter:** [critical, serious, moderate, minor]
- **User Notes:** [any specifics from Phase 0]
- **Part of Multi-Page Audit:** [yes/no - if yes, indicate page X of Y]
- **Previous Audit Baseline:** [path to previous report or "none"]

````

---

## E2: Reporting Preferences

**INSERT AFTER:** Phase 0, Step 5 (Audit Preferences)
**INSERT BEFORE:** The framework-specific intelligence section or `## Framework-Specific Intelligence`

````markdown
### Step 6: Reporting Preferences

Ask using AskUserQuestion:

1. **"Where should I write the audit report?"** - Options:
   - `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md` (default, project root)
   - Custom path - let me specify a file path
2. **"How should I organize findings in the report?"** - Options:
   - **By page** - group all issues under each audited URL (best for small audits, per-page remediation)
   - **By issue type** - group all instances of each rule across pages (best for seeing patterns and systemic issues)
   - **By severity** - critical first, then serious, moderate, minor (best for prioritizing fixes)
3. **"How much remediation detail should each finding include?"** - Options:
   - **Detailed** - full code fix with before/after, WCAG reference, impact explanation, and testing steps
   - **Summary** - brief description, code fix, and WCAG reference only
   - **Findings only** - just the issue description, severity, and location (no remediation guidance)

Store these preferences for use in Phase 10 report generation.

## E3: Re-scan & Delta Options

### E3a: Step 1 additions

**REPLACE:** The Phase 0, Step 1 section. The new Step 1 adds two new options to the existing list.

````markdown
### Step 1: App State

Ask: **"What state is your application in?"**
Options:
- **Development** - Running locally, not yet deployed
- **Production** - Live and accessible via a public URL
- **Re-scan with comparison** - Re-audit pages and compare results against a previous audit report
- **Changed pages only** - Audit only pages/components modified since the last audit
````

### E3b: Step 7 for delta configuration

**INSERT AFTER:** Step 6 (Reporting Preferences, from E2 above)
**INSERT BEFORE:** `## Framework-Specific Intelligence`

````markdown
### Step 7: Delta Scan Configuration

If the user selected **Re-scan with comparison** or **Changed pages only** in Step 1, configure the delta detection method.

Ask: **"How should I detect which pages or components have changed?"**
Options:
- **Git diff** - use `git diff --name-only` to find source files changed since the last commit/tag, then map to affected pages
- **Since last audit** - compare against the previous audit report's date and re-scan all pages that were in it
- **Since a specific date** - let me specify a cutoff date for source file changes
- **Against a baseline report** - compare current results against a specific previous `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`

If the user selects **Git diff**, ask: **"What git reference should I compare against?"**
Options:
- **Last commit** - files changed in the most recent commit
- **Last tag** - files changed since the last git tag
- **Specific branch/commit** - let me specify a ref
- **Last N days** - files changed in the last N days

If the user selects **Against a baseline report**, ask: **"What is the path to the previous audit report?"**
Let the user provide the path to a previous `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md` file.

**Mapping source changes to pages:** When using git diff, map changed source files to affected pages/routes:
1. Read the project's routing configuration (e.g., `pages/` directory in Next.js, route definitions in React Router, Angular routing module)
2. Identify which pages use the changed components/files
3. Include those pages in the audit scope
4. Report: "Based on git changes, these N pages are affected: [list]"

Store the delta configuration for use in scanning phases and in the report's Remediation Tracking section.

## E4: Large Crawl Handling

**INSERT AFTER:** The `### Crawl Depth Rules` section (after the bullet for "Full site crawl")
**INSERT BEFORE:** The `### Thoroughness Rules` section

````markdown
### Large Crawl Handling

If a full site crawl discovers more than **50 pages**:

1. **Warn the user immediately:**
   ```text
    Full crawl discovered [N] pages. Scanning all of them will take significant time
   and may produce a very large report.
   ```

2. **Offer options using AskUserQuestion:**
   - **Scan all [N] pages** - proceed with the full crawl (may take a while)
   - **Scan a representative sample** - select 15-25 pages proportionally across site sections
   - **Scan key page types only** - one of each unique template/layout (home, listing, detail, form, error, etc.)
   - **Let me pick pages** - show the discovered page list and let the user select

3. **Sampling strategy** (if the user selects representative sample):
   - Group discovered pages by URL path pattern (e.g., `/products/*`, `/blog/*`, `/account/*`)
   - Select 2-3 pages from each group, prioritizing:
     - The group's index/landing page
     - A page with forms or interactive elements
     - A page with data tables or media
   - Always include: home page, login/signup (if present), at least one form page, at least one content-heavy page

4. **Extrapolation reporting** (when sampling was used):

   ```text
    Sample-Based Audit Summary

   Pages discovered:  [N]
   Pages sampled:     [M] ([M/N]%)

   Extrapolated findings:
     Systemic issues (found on shared layout): likely affect all [N] pages
     Template issues (found on [type] pages): likely affect ~[count] pages of that type
     Page-specific issues: found on [count] sampled pages

    This is an estimate. Run a full scan to confirm all instances.
   Recommended: Fix systemic issues first, then re-scan to verify.
   ```

## E5: Page Metadata Dashboard

**INSERT AFTER:** The `#### Confidence Summary` section inside Phase 10 report
**INSERT BEFORE:** `#### Framework-Specific Notes`

````markdown
#### Page Metadata Dashboard

Collect and summarize web page metadata across all audited pages:

```markdown
## Page Metadata Dashboard

| Property | Set | Missing/Invalid | Percentage |
|----------|-----|-----------------|------------|
| Page Title (`<title>`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Language (`<html lang>`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Meta Description | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Viewport Meta | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Canonical URL (`<link rel="canonical">`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Open Graph Title (`og:title`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Open Graph Description (`og:description`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Open Graph Image Alt | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Skip Navigation Link | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Main Landmark (`<main>`) | [n] | [n] | [%] |

### Page Titles
| Page URL | Title | Unique? | Descriptive? |
|----------|-------|---------|-------------- |
| [url] | [title text] | / | / |

### Language Settings
| Page URL | `lang` Attribute | Valid BCP 47? |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| [url] | [value or "missing"] | / |

### Viewport Configuration
| Page URL | Viewport Meta | Scalable? | Issues |
|----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| [url] | [content value] | / | [e.g., "maximum-scale=1 blocks zoom"] |
```

Metadata flags that affect accessibility:

- **Missing `lang`** -> Screen readers may mispronounce content or use wrong pronunciation rules
- **Missing or generic `<title>`** -> Users can't identify the page in AT, browser tabs, or bookmarks
- **`maximum-scale=1` or `user-scalable=no`** -> Blocks pinch-to-zoom, fails WCAG 1.4.4
- **Missing skip navigation** -> Keyboard users must tab through entire nav on every page
- **Missing `<main>` landmark** -> Screen reader users can't jump to main content
- **Duplicate page titles across pages** -> Users can't distinguish between pages in AT

````

## E6: Component/Template Analysis

**INSERT AFTER:** The `#### Page Metadata Dashboard` section (E5 above)
**INSERT BEFORE:** `#### Framework-Specific Notes`

````markdown
#### Shared Component Analysis

Detect reused components and templates to identify high-ROI fixes - fixing a shared component remediates every page that uses it.

```markdown
## Shared Component Analysis

### Layout/Template Detection

Identify pages that share common layouts, templates, or wrapper components:

| Layout/Template | Pages Using | Shared Issues | Impact |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| [e.g., MainLayout] | [count] pages | [count] issues | Fix component to remediate [N] pages |
| [e.g., DashboardLayout] | [count] pages | [count] issues | Fix component to remediate [N] pages |

### Shared Component Issues

Components reused across multiple pages that have accessibility issues:

| Component | Used On | Issue | Severity | Fix Once -> Fix All |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| [e.g., `<NavBar>`] | All pages | Missing skip link | Serious |  Yes - [N] pages |
| [e.g., `<Footer>`] | All pages | Ambiguous "Read more" links | Moderate |  Yes - [N] pages |
| [e.g., `<DataTable>`] | 5 pages | Missing `<caption>` | Serious |  Yes - 5 pages |
| [e.g., `<Modal>`] | 3 pages | No focus trap | Critical |  Yes - 3 pages |

### Component Remediation Priority

Fixing shared components has the highest ROI. Prioritize these first:

1. **[Component]** - affects [N] pages, [severity] issue -> fix in [file path]
2. **[Component]** - affects [N] pages, [severity] issue -> fix in [file path]
3. ...

### Template Recommendations

If shared layouts or component libraries are causing widespread issues:
- Fix the component/template source file to prevent future pages from inheriting the problem
- After fixing, re-scan affected pages to verify remediation
- Consider adding accessibility tests to the component's unit tests to prevent regressions
```

## E7: Follow-Up Actions (Phase 11)

**INSERT AFTER:** The entirety of Phase 10 (after the last section of Phase 10's report structure)
**INSERT BEFORE:** `## Additional Agents to Consider` (or at the end if that section doesn't exist yet - adjust as needed)

````markdown
## Phase 11: Follow-Up Actions

After the report is written, offer structured next steps.

Ask using AskUserQuestion: **"The audit report has been written to [report path]. What would you like to do next?"**
Options:
- **Fix issues on a specific page** - select a page, then delegate to `web-issue-fixer` with that page's findings
- **Set up scan configuration** - create or update `.a11y-web-config.json` with rules, thresholds, and scan scope
- **Re-scan a subset of pages** - re-audit specific pages after making fixes
- **Export findings as CSV/JSON** - export for tracking systems, project management tools, or spreadsheets
- **Export in compliance format (VPAT/ACR)** - generate a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template or Accessibility Conformance Report
- **Generate remediation scripts** - create scripts to automate fixable issues across the codebase
- **Compare with a previous audit** - diff this audit against a baseline report to track progress
- **Hand off to document-accessibility-wizard** - if the project also has Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF documents to audit
- **End session** - I'll review the report on my own

### Sub-Agent Handoff for Remediation

When the user wants to fix issues on a specific page, hand off with full context:

```

## Remediation Handoff to web-issue-fixer

- **Page URL:** [url]
- **Framework:** [detected framework]
- **Issues to Fix:**
  1. [Issue #] - [description] ([file:line] or [CSS selector])
  2. [Issue #] - [description] ([file:line] or [CSS selector])
  3. [Issue #] - [description] ([file:line] or [CSS selector])
- **User Request:** [fix all / fix specific issues / fix auto-fixable only]
- **Scan Profile Used:** [quick scan / standard / deep dive]
- **axe-core Scan Available:** [yes - re-run after fixes / no]

```text

### Export as CSV/JSON

If the user selects **Export findings as CSV/JSON**, ask which format:
- **CSV** - comma-separated values, one row per finding
- **JSON** - structured JSON array of findings
- **Both** - generate both formats

Generate the export file with these fields per finding:

```

issue_number, page_url, severity, confidence, wcag_criterion, category, description, location, source, fix_applied, status

```text

Write to: `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-FINDINGS.csv` and/or `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-FINDINGS.json`
````

## E8: VPAT/ACR Compliance Export

**INSERT INSIDE:** Phase 11, after the `### Export as CSV/JSON` block

````markdown
### Compliance Format Export (VPAT/ACR)

If the user selects **Export in compliance format (VPAT/ACR)**, ask which edition using AskUserQuestion:
- **VPAT 2.5 (WCAG)** - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, WCAG edition
- **VPAT 2.5 (508)** - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, Section 508 edition
- **VPAT 2.5 (EN 301 549)** - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, EU edition
- **VPAT 2.5 (INT)** - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, International edition (all three combined)
- **Custom ACR** - Accessibility Conformance Report in a custom format

Generate the compliance report by mapping audit findings to the appropriate standard's criteria:

| WCAG Criterion | Level | Conformance | Remarks & Explanations |
|---------------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content | A | [Supports / Partially Supports / Does Not Support / Not Applicable] | [Based on findings - cite specific issues or state no issues found] |

Conformance levels:
- **Supports** - No findings for this criterion across any audited page
- **Partially Supports** - Some pages pass, some fail, or only some instances of this criterion fail
- **Does Not Support** - All or most audited pages fail this criterion
- **Not Applicable** - Criterion does not apply to the content audited (e.g., no audio/video content)
- **Not Evaluated** - Criterion was not tested in this audit scope

Write the VPAT/ACR to: `ACCESSIBILITY-VPAT.md` (or the user's chosen path).

## E9: Batch Remediation Scripts

**INSERT INSIDE:** Phase 11, after the `### Compliance Format Export (VPAT/ACR)` block (E8 above)

````markdown
### Batch Remediation Scripts

If the user selects **Generate remediation scripts**, ask which format using AskUserQuestion:
- **PowerShell** - `.ps1` script for Windows environments
- **Bash** - `.sh` script for macOS/Linux environments
- **Both** - generate both versions

Generate scripts that automate fixable issues across the codebase:

**Automatable fixes** (safe to script):
- Adding `lang` attribute to `<html>` elements
- Adding missing `alt=""` to decorative images (images identified as decorative by context)
- Removing positive `tabindex` values (replacing with `tabindex="0"` or removing entirely)
- Adding `scope="col"` or `scope="row"` to `<th>` elements missing scope
- Adding `(opens in new tab)` visually-hidden text to `target="_blank"` links
- Adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links
- Replacing `outline: none` with visible focus styles
- Adding viewport meta tag if missing
- Adding `autocomplete` attributes to identity/payment form fields

**Non-automatable fixes** (require human judgment):
- Writing meaningful alt text for content images
- Restructuring heading hierarchy
- Rewriting ambiguous link text
- Adding ARIA roles and states to custom widgets
- Placing live regions for dynamic content
- Designing focus management for SPA route changes
- Creating accessible error messages

The script MUST include:
1. A dry-run mode (`-WhatIf` / `--dry-run`) that previews changes without modifying files
2. Backup creation before any modification (copies original file to `.bak`)
3. A summary log of all changes made
4. Clear comments explaining each fix
5. Framework-aware file targeting (e.g., scanning `.jsx`/`.tsx` for React, `.vue` for Vue, `.svelte` for Svelte)

Example script structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Web Accessibility Remediation Script
# Generated by: web-accessibility-wizard
# Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
# Audit report: [report path]

DRY_RUN="${1:-}"
BACKUP_DIR=".a11y-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "--dry-run" ]; then
  echo " DRY RUN MODE - no files will be modified"
fi

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

FIXES_APPLIED=0
FIXES_SKIPPED=0

# Fix 1: Add lang attribute to <html> elements missing it
echo "--- Fix 1: Missing <html lang> ---"
FILES=$(grep -rl '<html[^>]*>' --include='*.html' --include='*.jsx' --include='*.tsx' . | xargs grep -lL 'lang=' 2>/dev/null || true)
for f in $FILES; do
  if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "--dry-run" ]; then
    echo "  Would fix: $f"
    ((FIXES_SKIPPED++))
  else
    cp "$f" "$BACKUP_DIR/$(basename "$f")"
    sed -i 's/<html/<html lang="en"/' "$f"
    echo "  Fixed: $f"
    ((FIXES_APPLIED++))
  fi
done

# [Additional fixes follow same pattern...]

echo ""
echo ""
echo "Remediation Summary"
echo "  Applied: $FIXES_APPLIED fixes"
echo "  Skipped: $FIXES_SKIPPED (dry-run or human-judgment required)"
echo "  Backups: $BACKUP_DIR"
echo ""
echo ""
echo "Next: Re-run the accessibility audit to verify fixes."
```

Write the script to: `scripts/a11y-remediate.sh` and/or `scripts/a11y-remediate.ps1`

## E10: CI/CD Integration Guide (Phase 12)

**INSERT AFTER:** Phase 11 (the entirety of E7, E8, E9)
**INSERT BEFORE:** `## Additional Agents to Consider`

````markdown
## Phase 12: CI/CD Integration Guide

When the user requests CI/CD integration, or after any audit where no `.a11y-web-config.json` exists, proactively offer to generate a CI/CD integration guide.

Ask using AskUserQuestion: **"Would you like a CI/CD integration guide for automated web accessibility scanning?"**
Options:
- **Yes - GitHub Actions** - generate a GitHub Actions workflow
- **Yes - Azure DevOps** - generate an Azure Pipelines YAML
- **Yes - Generic CI** - generate a generic script-based approach
- **No thanks** - skip CI/CD setup

### Generic CI Integration

Provide a shell script `scripts/ci-a11y-scan.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Web Accessibility CI Scan Script
# Usage: ./scripts/ci-a11y-scan.sh [URL] [--fail-on-serious]

URL="${1:-http://localhost:3000}"
FAIL_MODE="${2:-}"
OUTPUT="accessibility-results.json"
REPORT="ACCESSIBILITY-SCAN.md"

echo "Web Accessibility CI Scan"
echo "URL: $URL"
echo ""

# Run axe-core scan
echo "Running axe-core scan..."
npx @axe-core/cli "$URL" \
  --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa,wcag21a,wcag21aa \
  --save "$OUTPUT"

# Count violations by impact
CRITICAL=$(cat "$OUTPUT" | node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log(d.flatMap(p=>p.violations).filter(v=>v.impact==='critical').length)")
SERIOUS=$(cat "$OUTPUT" | node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log(d.flatMap(p=>p.violations).filter(v=>v.impact==='serious').length)")
MODERATE=$(cat "$OUTPUT" | node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log(d.flatMap(p=>p.violations).filter(v=>v.impact==='moderate').length)")
MINOR=$(cat "$OUTPUT" | node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log(d.flatMap(p=>p.violations).filter(v=>v.impact==='minor').length)")

echo ""
echo "Results:"
echo "  Critical: $CRITICAL"

  TOTAL=$((CRITICAL + SERIOUS))
  if [ "$TOTAL" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo " FAIL: $TOTAL critical/serious accessibility violations found"
    exit 1
  else
    echo " PASS: No critical or serious violations"
    exit 0
  fi

echo "Scan complete. Results: $OUTPUT"
```

### Configuration File for CI

Offer to create `.a11y-web-config.json` (see E13) for the CI pipeline to use as its configuration source.

## E11: Edge Cases

**INSERT AFTER:** `## Behavioral Rules` section (at the end of the behavioral rules list)
**INSERT BEFORE:** End of file (or before any final closing section)

````markdown
## Edge Cases

### Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
- SPAs render content dynamically - axe-core only scans the current DOM state
- For SPAs, navigate to each route before scanning (use Playwright or Puppeteer to automate navigation)
- Check that route changes announce the new page title to screen readers
- Verify focus is managed on route transitions (focus should move to the main content or page heading)
- Test that browser back/forward buttons work with screen readers

### Iframes
- Iframes create separate document contexts - axe-core does not cross iframe boundaries by default
- Scan each iframe's `src` URL separately as an additional page
- Check that iframes have descriptive `title` attributes
- Verify keyboard focus can enter and exit iframes naturally
- Check `sandbox` attribute doesn't block accessibility features (e.g., `allow-scripts` for ARIA)

### Shadow DOM
- Shadow DOM encapsulation can hide elements from axe-core's DOM traversal
- Use `--include-shadow-dom` flag if available in the axe-core version
- Web components using shadow DOM must manage focus within their shadow roots
- `aria-*` attributes on shadow DOM hosts may not pierce the shadow boundary in all browsers
- Document any shadow DOM components that could not be scanned and recommend manual testing

### Web Components / Custom Elements
- Custom elements (`<my-component>`) must expose accessibility semantics via ARIA or `ElementInternals`
- Check that custom elements that extend interactive semantics have proper role, states, and keyboard handling
- Verify `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback` handle focus management
- Look for `attachInternals()` usage for form-associated custom elements

### Lazy-Loaded Content
- Content loaded via infinite scroll, lazy loading, or intersection observers may not be present in the DOM at scan time
- Scroll to bottom of page before scanning to trigger lazy-loaded elements
- Check that lazy-loaded images have `alt` attributes set (not just placeholder values)
- Verify "Load more" buttons are keyboard accessible and announce new content

### Third-Party Widgets
- Third-party widgets (chat widgets, analytics overlays, consent banners, embedded maps) often introduce accessibility issues outside your control
- Document third-party widget issues separately from first-party code
- Note that third-party issues may not be fixable - recommend contacting the vendor or finding accessible alternatives
- Check that third-party widgets don't create keyboard traps
- Verify consent banners are keyboard accessible and have proper focus management

### PDF Links on Web Pages
- If the web application links to PDF documents, note this in the report
- Recommend that PDF links indicate file type and size: `"Annual Report (PDF, 2.4 MB)"`
- Suggest handing off PDF accessibility review to `document-accessibility-wizard`

### Password-Protected / Staging Environments
- If the target URL requires authentication, the user must provide credentials or a pre-authenticated session
- Ask the user: "Does this URL require login? If so, please ensure you're logged in and provide a session cookie or authenticated URL."
- For staging environments behind VPNs, the scan must run from a machine with VPN access
- Document any pages that could not be scanned due to authentication and recommend manual testing

### Auth-Gated Content
- Content behind login forms (dashboards, account pages, settings) requires authentication before scanning
- Ask: "Are there pages behind a login? If so, how should I access them?" Options:
  - **Pre-authenticated URL/token** - user provides a URL with auth token
  - **Login credentials for scanning** - user provides test account credentials (handle securely - never log or store)
  - **Skip auth-gated pages** - only scan public pages
  - **I'll navigate manually** - user logs in, then scanning proceeds

### Cookies / Session State
- Some pages display different content based on cookie state (e.g., A/B tests, personalization, consent state)
- If possible, scan in a clean browser context (incognito/private mode) for consistent results
- Document if different cookie states affect accessibility (e.g., a consent banner that traps focus only appears for new visitors)
- If using Playwright for screenshots, launch in a clean context: `--browser-context new`

## E12: Report Enhancements

These blocks enhance the Phase 10 report structure.

### E12a: Organization Modes

**INSERT AFTER:** Phase 10's report structure section (after the base `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md` structure)
**INSERT BEFORE:** `### Consolidation Rules`

````markdown
### Organization Modes

If the user selected a different organization mode in Phase 0 Step 6 (Reporting Preferences):

**By issue type:** Group all instances of each rule or finding pattern together, listing affected pages under each rule. Example:

```markdown
## Findings by Issue Type

### Missing Alt Text
**WCAG:** 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A) | **Severity:** Critical | **Instances:** 12 across 5 pages

| Page | Element | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| /home | Hero image | `img.hero-banner` |
| /about | Team photo | `section.team img:nth-child(2)` |
| /products | Product thumbnail | `div.product-card img` (x3) |
| ... | | |

**Recommended fix:** [code example]

---

### Missing Form Labels
**WCAG:** 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A) | **Severity:** Serious | **Instances:** 6 across 2 pages
...
```

**By severity:** List all critical issues first (across all pages), then all serious, moderate, minor. Example:

```markdown
## Critical Issues (across all pages)

### 1. [description] - /checkout
### 2. [description] - /dashboard
### 3. [description] - /home

## Serious Issues (across all pages)
...

## Moderate Issues (across all pages)
...
```

**By page (default):** Group all findings under each audited URL, as shown in the base report structure.

````

### E12b: Findings by Rule Cross-Reference Table

**INSERT INSIDE:** The Phase 10 report markdown template, after the severity-grouped findings sections

````markdown
## Findings by Rule Cross-Reference

| axe-core Rule / Agent Finding | Severity | WCAG | Pages Affected | Total Instances |
|------------------------------|----------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| image-alt | Critical | 1.1.1 | 5 of 8 pages | 12 |
| color-contrast | Serious | 1.4.3 | 3 of 8 pages | 8 |
| label | Serious | 1.3.1 | 2 of 8 pages | 6 |
| heading-order | Moderate | 1.3.1 | 4 of 8 pages | 4 |
| link-name | Moderate | 2.4.4 | 6 of 8 pages | 15 |
| ... | | | | |

This cross-reference helps identify systemic issues. Rules affecting the most pages should be prioritized - they often stem from shared components or templates.
````

### E12c: Configuration Recommendations

**INSERT INSIDE:** The Phase 10 report markdown template, after `## Recommended Testing Setup`

````markdown
## Configuration Recommendations

Based on this audit's findings, here are recommended scan configurations for ongoing monitoring:

### Recommended `.a11y-web-config.json` Settings
```json
{
  "urls": ["[list of audited URLs]"],
  "standard": "WCAG 2.2 AA",
  "rules": {
    "enabled": ["[rules that found issues - keep monitoring]"],
    "disabled": ["[rules confirmed not applicable]"]
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "maxViolations": {
      "critical": 0,
      "serious": 5
    },
    "minScore": 75
  }
}
```

### Recommended Scan Frequency

- **After every PR** - run axe-core against changed pages (use delta scan with git diff)
- **Weekly** - full site scan to catch regressions and third-party widget changes
- **Before release** - full deep-dive audit of all pages

### Rules to Monitor

Based on this audit, these rules had the highest violation rates and should be actively monitored:

1. [rule] - [count] violations across [pages]
2. [rule] - [count] violations across [pages]
3. ...

````

### E12d: Expanded What Passed

**INSERT:** Replace the existing `## What Passed` section in the report template

````markdown
## What Passed

Acknowledge what the project does well. A complete audit reports both failures AND successes.

### Categories with No Issues Found
| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [e.g., Form Labels] |  Pass | All form inputs have associated labels |
| [e.g., Heading Structure] |  Pass | Single H1, no skipped levels on all pages |
| [e.g., Keyboard Access] |  Pass | All interactive elements reachable by keyboard |
| ... | | |

### Pages with No Issues
| Page URL | Score | Grade |
|----------|-------|-------|
| [url] | 100/100 | A |
| [url] | 95/100 | A |

### Well-Implemented Patterns
Highlight specific accessibility patterns the project implements correctly:
- [e.g., "Skip navigation link present on all pages and functions correctly"]
- [e.g., "Focus management on SPA route changes properly moves focus to main heading"]
- [e.g., "Form validation uses `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and moves focus to first error"]
- [e.g., "Dark mode maintains adequate contrast ratios across all tested elements"]

## Web Scan Configuration

### `.a11y-web-config.json` Schema

The web accessibility wizard looks for `.a11y-web-config.json` in the workspace root to configure scanning behavior. If not found, defaults are used and the wizard offers to create one after the audit.

```json

### Config Resolution Order

The wizard resolves configuration in this order (later sources override earlier):

1. **Built-in defaults** - the defaults shown in the schema above
2. **`.a11y-web-config.json`** - workspace root config file (if present)
3. **Phase 0 user answers** - interactive choices override config file settings
4. **CLI arguments** - if invoked from CI scripts with explicit arguments

### Config Detection

The wizard checks for `.a11y-web-config.json` at startup. If found, it reports:

```text
 Found .a11y-web-config.json:
  URLs configured: [count]
  Standard: [value]
  Disabled rules: [count or "none"]
  Thresholds: min score [value], fail on [severity]
  Baseline: [path or "not set"]
```

If not found, the wizard proceeds with defaults and offers to create the config file in Phase 11.
