# Accessibility-First Development

This workspace enforces WCAG AA accessibility standards for all web UI code.

## Mandatory Accessibility Check

Before writing or modifying any web UI code - including HTML, JSX, CSS, React components, Tailwind classes, web pages, forms, modals, or any user-facing web content - you MUST:

1. Consider which accessibility skills are needed for the task
2. Apply the relevant specialist knowledge before generating code
3. Verify the output against the appropriate checklists

**Automatic trigger detection:** If a user prompt involves creating, editing, or reviewing any file matching `*.html`, `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.astro`, or `*.css` - or if the prompt describes building UI components, pages, forms, or visual elements - treat it as a web UI task and apply the Decision Matrix below to determine which skills are needed. Do not wait for the user to explicitly request accessibility review.

## Decision Matrix

- **New component or page:** Always apply aria-specialist + keyboard-navigator + alt-text-headings guidance. Add forms-specialist for any inputs, contrast-master for styling, modal-specialist for overlays, live-region-controller for dynamic updates, tables-data-specialist for any data tables.
- **Modifying existing UI:** At minimum apply keyboard-navigator (tab order breaks easily). Add others based on what changed.
- **Code review/audit:** Apply all specialist checklists. Use web-accessibility-wizard for guided web audits.
- **Document audit:** Use document-accessibility-wizard for Office and PDF accessibility audits.
- **Mobile app (React Native / Expo / iOS / Android):** Apply cognitive-accessibility guidance. Use mobile-accessibility for touch target checks.
- **Cognitive / UX clarity / plain language:** Use cognitive-accessibility for WCAG 2.2 SC 3.3.7, 3.3.8, 3.3.9, COGA guidance, error message quality, and reading level analysis.
- **Design system / tokens:** Use design-system-auditor to validate color token pairs, focus ring tokens, spacing tokens, and motion tokens.
- **Data tables:** Always apply tables-data-specialist for any tabular data display.
- **Links:** Always apply link-checker when pages contain hyperlinks.
- **Images or media:** Always apply alt-text-headings.
- **Testing guidance:** Use testing-coach for screen reader testing, keyboard testing, and automated testing setup.
- **WCAG questions:** Use wcag-guide to understand specific WCAG success criteria and conformance requirements.

## Context Discovery

When starting any accessibility audit, review, or remediation task, proactively check the workspace for existing context before proceeding:

1. **Scan configuration files:** Check the workspace root for `.a11y-office-config.json`, `.a11y-pdf-config.json`, and `.a11y-web-config.json`. If any exist, read them to determine which rules are enabled/disabled, severity filters, and custom settings.
2. **Previous audit reports:** Check for existing `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, `WEB-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, `DOCUMENT-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, and `MARKDOWN-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md` in the workspace root. If found, note the date, overall score, and issue count. Offer comparison/delta mode.
3. **Scan config templates:** If no config file exists, mention that pre-built profiles (strict, moderate, minimal) are available in the `templates/` directory.

## Non-Negotiable Standards

- Semantic HTML before ARIA (`<button>` not `<div role="button">`)
- One H1 per page, never skip heading levels
- Every interactive element reachable and operable by keyboard
- Text contrast 4.5:1, UI component contrast 3:1
- No information conveyed by color alone
- Focus managed on route changes, dynamic content, and deletions
- Modals trap focus and return focus on close
- Live regions for all dynamic content updates

For tasks that do not involve any user-facing web content (backend logic, scripts, database work), these requirements do not apply.
