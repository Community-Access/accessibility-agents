# Accessibility-First Development

This workspace enforces WCAG AA accessibility standards for all web UI code.

## Repository Writing Policy: No Emoji

Repository-wide hard rule: do not add emoji characters in generated, edited, or reviewed content.

- Applies to release notes, changelog entries, docs, prompts, instructions, agent files, issue/PR text, and chat-generated copy intended for repository publication.
- Replace emoji with plain text labels.
- If existing content contains emoji and you are touching that content, remove emoji as part of the update.

## Hook-Based Enforcement

Accessibility review is enforced by three global hooks, not just instructions:

1. **Proactive detection** (`UserPromptSubmit`) — Detects web projects automatically and injects the delegation instruction on every prompt.
2. **Edit gate** (`PreToolUse`) — Blocks Edit/Write to UI files (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.css`, `.html`, etc.) until accessibility-lead has been consulted. Uses `permissionDecision: "deny"`.
3. **Session marker** (`PostToolUse`) — Creates a marker when accessibility-lead completes, unlocking the edit gate.

If the edit gate blocks you, delegate to `accessibility-agents:accessibility-lead` first. After the review completes, UI file edits are unlocked for the rest of the session.

See `docs/hooks-guide.md` for the full technical breakdown.

## Mandatory Accessibility Check

Before writing or modifying any web UI code - including HTML, JSX, CSS, React components, Tailwind classes, web pages, forms, modals, or any user-facing web content - you MUST:

1. Consider which accessibility specialist agents are needed for the task
2. Apply the relevant specialist knowledge before generating code
3. Verify the output against the appropriate checklists

**Automatic trigger detection:** If a user prompt involves creating, editing, or reviewing any file matching `*.html`, `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.astro`, or `*.css` - or if the prompt describes building UI components, pages, forms, or visual elements - treat it as a web UI task and apply the Decision Matrix below to determine which specialists are needed. Do not wait for the user to explicitly request accessibility review.

## Agent Teams

Team coordination is defined in `.claude/agents/AGENTS.md`. Nine defined teams:

- **Document Accessibility Audit** - led by document-accessibility-wizard with format-specific sub-agents
- **Web Accessibility Audit** - led by accessibility-lead with all web specialist agents
- **Full Audit** - combined web + document audit workflow
- **Mobile Accessibility** - led by mobile-accessibility; invoked standalone or as handoff from accessibility-lead
- **Design System Accessibility** - led by design-system-auditor; validates tokens before UI propagation
- **Developer Tools** - led by developer-hub; routes to python-specialist, wxpython-specialist, nvda-addon-specialist, desktop-a11y-specialist, desktop-a11y-testing-coach, a11y-tool-builder, text-quality-reviewer for Python, wxPython, NVDA addons, desktop accessibility, and tool building. Cross-team handoffs to web-accessibility-wizard and document-accessibility-wizard.

## Decision Matrix

- **New component or page:** Always apply aria-specialist + keyboard-navigator + alt-text-headings guidance. Add forms-specialist for any inputs, contrast-master for styling, modal-specialist for overlays, live-region-controller for dynamic updates, tables-data-specialist for any data tables.
- **Modifying existing UI:** At minimum apply keyboard-navigator (tab order breaks easily). Add others based on what changed.
- **Code review/audit:** Apply all specialist checklists. Use web-accessibility-wizard for guided web audits.
- **Document audit:** Use document-accessibility-wizard for Office and PDF accessibility audits. Supports single files, folders, recursive scanning, delta scanning (changed files only), severity scoring, template analysis, remediation tracking across re-scans, compliance format export (VPAT/ACR), CSV export with help links, batch remediation scripts, and CI/CD integration guides.
- **Mobile app (React Native / Expo / iOS / Android):** Apply cognitive-accessibility guidance. Use mobile-accessibility for touch target checks, accessibilityLabel/Role/State audits, and platform-specific screen reader testing.
- **Cognitive / UX clarity / plain language:** Use cognitive-accessibility for WCAG 2.2 SC 3.3.7, 3.3.8, 3.3.9, COGA guidance, error message quality, and reading level analysis.
- **Design system / tokens:** Use design-system-auditor to validate color token pairs, focus ring tokens, spacing tokens, and motion tokens before they propagate to UI.
- **Data tables:** Always apply tables-data-specialist for any tabular data display.
- **Links:** Always apply link-checker when pages contain hyperlinks.
- **Images or media:** Always apply alt-text-headings.
- **Testing guidance:** Use testing-coach for screen reader testing, keyboard testing, and automated testing setup.
- **WCAG questions:** Use wcag-guide to understand specific WCAG success criteria and conformance requirements.
- **Python development:** Use developer-hub for any Python, wxPython, or desktop app task. Routes to python-specialist for language work and wxpython-specialist for GUI work.
- **Desktop app packaging:** Use python-specialist for PyInstaller, Nuitka, cx_Freeze builds and troubleshooting.
- **Desktop accessibility:** Use desktop-a11y-specialist for platform API implementation (UIA, MSAA, NSAccessibility), screen reader interaction, focus management, and high contrast support. Use desktop-a11y-testing-coach for screen reader testing walkthroughs and automated UIA tests.
- **Building accessibility tools:** Use a11y-tool-builder for designing rule engines, document parsers, report generators, severity scoring, and scanner architecture.

## Context Discovery

When starting any accessibility audit, review, or remediation task, proactively check the workspace for existing context before proceeding:

1. **Scan configuration files:** Check the workspace root for `.a11y-office-config.json`, `.a11y-pdf-config.json`, and `.a11y-web-config.json`. If any exist, read them to determine which rules are enabled/disabled, severity filters, and custom settings. Apply these configurations to the audit - do not use defaults when a config file exists.
2. **Previous audit reports:** Check for existing `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, `WEB-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, `DOCUMENT-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`, and `MARKDOWN-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md` in the workspace root. If found, note the date, overall score, and issue count. Offer comparison/delta mode so the user can track remediation progress.
3. **Scan config templates:** If no config file exists and the user is starting a new audit, mention that pre-built profiles (strict, moderate, minimal) are available in the `templates/` directory.

## VS Code 1.113 Features

VS Code 1.113 (March 2026) builds on the 1.112 platform improvements and adds several capabilities that directly improve accessibility agent workflows:

### Monorepo Customization Discovery

Enable `chat.useCustomizationsInParentRepositories` to discover accessibility agents from parent folders up to the repository root. This is essential for monorepo setups where you open a package subfolder rather than the repo root. See [docs/advanced/advanced-scanning-patterns.md](docs/advanced/advanced-scanning-patterns.md#monorepo-customization-discovery-vs-code-1112) for details.

### Agent Debugging

- **`/troubleshoot`** - Type `/troubleshoot` in chat to analyze agent debug logs and debug why instructions/agents aren't loading
- **Export/Import** - Save agent debug sessions as JSONL for offline analysis or team sharing
- **Agent Flow Chart** - Visualize agent orchestration sequences
- **CLI and Claude coverage** - Agent Debug Logs now support Copilot CLI and Claude agent sessions in addition to local sessions

Enable with: `github.copilot.chat.agentDebugLog.enabled` and `github.copilot.chat.agentDebugLog.fileLogging.enabled`

### MCP Across Agent Types

- **MCP support in Copilot CLI and Claude agents** - MCP servers registered in VS Code are now bridged into Copilot CLI and Claude agent workflows, including workspace `mcp.json` definitions.

### Chat Customizations Editor

- **`Chat: Open Chat Customizations`** - Centralized UI for managing instructions, prompt files, custom agents, skills, MCP servers, and plugins across agent types.

### Nested Subagents

- **`chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents`** - Enables recursive or coordinator-worker subagent patterns when deliberately needed. Keep it disabled by default unless an orchestration flow is designed for it.

### Image Analysis

Enable `chat.imageSupport.enabled` to allow agents to read images natively. This enhances:

- **alt-text-headings** - Analyze actual images to suggest accurate alt text
- **contrast-master** - Analyze screenshots for visual contrast issues

### Integrated Browser

The new `editor-browser` debug type allows debugging web apps without leaving VS Code. Useful for:

- Testing zoom/reflow accessibility (WCAG 1.4.4, 1.4.10)
- Visual debugging of focus management
- Screenshot capture for accessibility analysis
- Local HTTPS testing with self-signed certificates during development
- Sharing a live browser page directly with agents when browser tools are enabled

### Permission Levels

- **Autopilot** (`chat.autopilot.enabled`) - Fully autonomous operation. Good for read-only accessibility scans.
- **Bypass Approvals** - Auto-approve tools without dialogs. Useful for batch scanning.
- **Default** - Manual approval. Recommended for fix-applying workflows.

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for detailed guidance on when to use each level.

## Scan Configuration

The `templates/` directory contains pre-built scan configuration profiles:

- **strict** - All rules enabled, all severities reported
- **moderate** - All rules enabled, errors and warnings only
- **minimal** - Errors only, for quick triage

Copy the appropriate template to your project root:

- `.a11y-office-config.json` for Office document scanning
- `.a11y-pdf-config.json` for PDF scanning
- `.a11y-web-config.json` for web accessibility scanning

## Audit Report Quality Requirements

When generating any accessibility audit report (web, document, or markdown), the report MUST include all of these sections to be considered complete:

1. **Metadata** - audit date, tool versions, scope (URLs/files audited), scan configuration used
2. **Executive summary** - overall score (0-100, A-F grade), total issues by severity, pass/fail verdict
3. **Findings** - each issue with: rule ID, WCAG criterion, severity, affected element/location, description, remediation guidance
4. **Severity breakdown** - counts by Critical/Serious/Moderate/Minor
5. **Remediation priorities** - ordered list of what to fix first based on impact and effort
6. **Next steps** - recommended follow-up actions, re-scan timeline
7. **Delta tracking** (when a previous report exists) - Fixed/New/Persistent/Regressed issue counts

Do not consider an audit complete until the report contains all applicable sections. If generating a quick check (not a full audit), state explicitly that it is a triage result, not a complete audit report.

## Non-Negotiable Standards

- Semantic HTML before ARIA (`<button>` not `<div role="button">`)
- One H1 per page, never skip heading levels
- Every interactive element reachable and operable by keyboard
- Text contrast 4.5:1, UI component contrast 3:1
- No information conveyed by color alone
- Focus managed on route changes, dynamic content, and deletions
- Modals trap focus and return focus on close
- Live regions for all dynamic content updates

## Advanced Documentation

Additional guides in `docs/`:

- **cross-platform-handoff.md** - Seamless handoff between Claude Code and Copilot agent environments
- **advanced-scanning-patterns.md** - Background scanning, worktree isolation, and large library strategies
- **plugin-packaging.md** - Packaging and distributing agents for different environments
- **platform-references.md** - All external documentation sources used to build this project, with feature-to-source mapping

For tasks that do not involve any user-facing web content (backend logic, scripts, database work), these requirements do not apply.
