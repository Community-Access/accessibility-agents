# Architecture

## Why Agents Instead of Skills

**Skills** rely on the model deciding to check them. Activation rates are roughly 20% without intervention. Skills are a single block of instructions that get deprioritized as context grows.

**Agents** run in their own context window with a dedicated system prompt. The accessibility rules are not suggestions - they are the agent's entire identity. An ARIA specialist cannot forget about ARIA. A contrast master cannot skip contrast checks.

## Why Hooks Instead of Instructions

Agents solve the expertise problem but not the activation problem. Even with CLAUDE.md instructions saying "always delegate to accessibility-lead," LLMs treat text instructions as suggestions. In real-world testing, Claude would read the instruction, understand it, and still write UI code itself without delegating. The user had to manually ask "did you do accessibility review?" every time.

**Instructions are suggestions. Hooks are enforcement.**

The project uses a three-hook enforcement gate that makes it physically impossible for Claude to skip accessibility review:

1. **UserPromptSubmit** (`a11y-team-eval.sh`) — Proactively detects web projects and injects the delegation instruction before Claude starts working.
2. **PreToolUse** (`a11y-enforce-edit.sh`) — Hard blocks any Edit/Write to UI files (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.css`, `.html`, etc.) until the accessibility-lead agent has been consulted. Uses the `permissionDecision: "deny"` mechanism to reject the tool call entirely.
3. **PostToolUse** (`a11y-mark-reviewed.sh`) — Creates a session marker when the accessibility-lead agent completes. This marker unlocks the PreToolUse block for the rest of the session.

The result: Claude cannot write to a `.tsx` file without first running the accessibility-lead review. Not because it was told not to. Because the tool call is denied at the hook level.

See the [Hooks Guide](hooks-guide.md) for implementation details.

### Global hooks (installed to `~/.claude/hooks/`)

```text
~/.claude/hooks/
  a11y-team-eval.sh       # UserPromptSubmit — proactive web project detection
  a11y-enforce-edit.sh     # PreToolUse — blocks UI file edits without review
  a11y-mark-reviewed.sh    # PostToolUse — creates session marker after review
  swift-team-eval.sh       # UserPromptSubmit — Swift/Apple platform detection
```

## Agent Teams

Three coordinated multi-agent workflows defined in `.github/agents/AGENTS.md`:

| Team | Led By | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Document Accessibility Audit** | document-accessibility-wizard | Full document scanning pipeline |
| **Web Accessibility Audit** | accessibility-lead | Comprehensive web accessibility review |
| **Full Audit** | accessibility-lead | Combined web + document audit |

## Hidden Helper Sub-Agents

Internal agents not user-invokable, used by orchestrators for parallel work:

| Agent | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| document-inventory | document-accessibility-wizard | File discovery and inventory building |
| cross-document-analyzer | document-accessibility-wizard | Pattern detection and severity scoring |

## Agent Skills

Reusable knowledge modules in `.github/skills/`:

| Skill | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| document-scanning | File discovery, delta detection, scan config profiles |
| accessibility-rules | Cross-format rule reference with WCAG 2.2 mapping |
| report-generation | Report formatting, severity scoring, VPAT/ACR export |
