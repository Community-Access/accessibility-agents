Compare a current web accessibility audit against a previous one. Shows exactly which issues were fixed, which are new, which persist, and which have regressed - with an overall progress percentage and trend assessment.

## When to Use It

- You completed a remediation sprint and want to measure the improvement
- You want to verify that a deployment did not introduce new accessibility regressions
- You need to report progress to a stakeholder ("we reduced critical issues by 67%")
- You want to track accessibility health over multiple development cycles

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/compare-web-audits
```

The agent will ask for both report paths. Or specify them directly:

```text
/compare-web-audits previous: ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-jan.md current: ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-feb.md
```

## What to Expect

### Step 1: Report Selection

The agent asks:

1. **Previous audit** - path to the baseline report (default: looks for an existing `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`)
2. **Current audit** - path to the new report, or "run a new audit now" to scan the live URL first

### Step 2: Issue Classification

Every finding from both reports is classified:

| Classification | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Fixed | Was in the previous report, gone now - a win |
| New | Not in the previous report, appeared now - needs attention |
| Persistent | In both reports - highest priority for the next sprint |
| Regressed | Was fixed at some point but has returned |

### Step 3: Progress Report

```markdown
# Accessibility Remediation Progress

## Summary

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Total Issues | 24 | 11 | -13 |
| Critical | 4 | 1 | -3 |
| Serious | 8 | 4 | -4 |
| Overall Score | 61/100 | 83/100 | +22 |

## Progress: 54% of previous issues resolved

### Fixed Issues (13) 
...

### New Issues (0) 
...

### Persistent Issues (11)
[List - prioritize these for next sprint]

### Regressed Issues (0) 

## Trend: Improving
```

### Step 4: Remediation Offer

After the comparison, the agent asks: "Want to focus on fixing the persistent issues now?" - launching [fix-web-issues](./fix-web-issues.md) pre-loaded with the persistent finding list.

## Example Variations

```text
/compare-web-audits
-> Use ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-2026-01.md as baseline
-> Run a new audit on https://myapp.com now

/compare-web-audits
-> Compare ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-sprint-12.md vs ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT-sprint-13.md
```

Each agent, with its role.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| [web-accessibility-wizard](../../../reference/skills/web-accessibility-wizard.md) | Parses both reports and runs any new audits needed |
| [cross-page-analyzer](../../../reference/skills/cross-page-analyzer.md) | Performs the Fixed/New/Persistent/Regressed classification |
