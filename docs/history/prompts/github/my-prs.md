Show a prioritized dashboard of all your open pull requests - split into "Your PRs" (authored) and "Awaiting Your Review" - with status signals and recommended actions.

## When to Use It

- Morning check to see what PRs need attention today
- Quick scan during the day for new review requests
- Before a standup to know the status of your PRs
- Catching PRs that are stale or blocked

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/my-prs
```

With optional scope:

```text
/my-prs owner/repo
/my-prs all repos
```

## What to Expect

1. **Query GitHub** - Find all open PRs you authored and all open PRs that have requested your review
2. **Classify each PR** - Assign a status signal based on review state, CI, and age
3. **Render dashboard** - Two-section table output in chat

### Status Signals

Each signal, with its meaning.

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Ready to merge | Approved + CI passing + no conflicts |
| Needs update | Review requested changes |
| Blocked | CI failing or merge conflicts unresolved |
| Awaiting review | Draft or waiting for reviewers |
| Stale | No activity in 7+ days |

### Sample Output

```text

```

## Example Variations

```text
/my-prs                            # All repos, your PRs + your review queue
/my-prs owner/repo                 # Scoped to one repo
