Fetch the latest accessibility-related GitHub issues and discussions across tracked repositories. Results are scoped by keyword, grouped by access need category, and include the relevant WCAG criterion and ARIA pattern for each item.

## When to Use It

- Weekly review of accessibility issues to prioritize
- Preparing for an audit by seeing what known issues exist
- Tracking what the community has identified as broken or missing
- Finding upstream accessibility bugs in dependencies

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/a11y-update
```

With scope:

```text
/a11y-update owner/repo
/a11y-update org:myorg
/a11y-update last 14 days
```

## What to Expect

1. **Scope parsing** - Determines repos to search from parameters or configured preferences
2. **Collect issues** - Finds issues with accessibility-related labels or keywords (`a11y`, `accessibility`, `screen-reader`, `keyboard`, `wcag`, `aria`)
3. **Classify by access need** - Groups findings into 6 categories
4. **Enrich** - Adds the relevant WCAG success criterion and ARIA pattern for each item
5. **Display with impact level** - High / Medium / Low priority based on user impact

### Access Need Categories

Each category, with what it covers.

| Category | What it covers |
|----------|---------------|
| Screen Reader | ARIA, semantic HTML, announcements, live regions |
| Keyboard | Focus management, tab order, keyboard traps, shortcuts |
| Visual | Color contrast, motion, zoom, high contrast mode |
| Audio | Captions, transcripts, audio controls |
| Cognitive | Plain language, reading level, error clarity, timeouts |
| Other | Uncategorized or multi-category issues |

### Per-Issue Information

Each issue includes:

- Issue number and title with link
- Repo context
- Relevant WCAG success criterion (e.g., WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast)
- Relevant ARIA pattern if applicable (e.g., combobox, dialog)
- Impact: High / Medium / Low
- Days open and last activity

### Sample Output
