Generate a personal contribution analytics report - PRs authored and merged, reviews given, issues filed and closed, cycle time trends, and a period-over-period comparison.

## When to Use It

- Weekly self-review to understand your own contribution patterns
- Performance review preparation - gathering concrete metrics
- Identifying where cycle times are slow (reviews taking too long, PRs sitting open)
- Comparing your current period velocity to previous periods

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/my-stats
```

With period:

```text
/my-stats last 30 days
/my-stats this month
/my-stats Q1 2026
/my-stats owner/repo
```

## What to Expect

1. **Collect your activity** - PRs authored, reviewed, issues filed, comments posted across repos
2. **Compute metrics** - Merge rate, review cycle time, issue resolution time
3. **Period comparison** - Current period vs. previous same-length period
4. **Trend indicators** - Up/down/flat per metric
5. **Save report** - Written to `.github/reviews/analytics/my-stats-{date}.md` and `.html`

### Metric Categories

### Period-Over-Period Table

```text

```

### Team Comparison (optional)

If the agent has access to org-level data, it can show your rank relative to collaborators (anonymized by default):

```text
Review responsiveness: You - 4.2h avg | Team median - 6.1h  Up Above median
PR merge rate: You - 88% | Team median - 79%  Up Above median
```
