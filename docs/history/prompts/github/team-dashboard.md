Generate a team contributions dashboard - per-member PRs, reviews, and pending review requests - with bottleneck detection for PRs waiting 7+ days for review.

## When to Use It

- Engineering manager weekly check on team activity
- Sprint planning - understanding who has bandwidth
- Identifying review bottlenecks (PRs waiting too long)
- Onboarding - seeing how a team is distributed across repos

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/team-dashboard owner/repo
```

With org scope:

```text
/team-dashboard org:myorg
/team-dashboard org:myorg last 14 days
```

## What to Expect

1. **Identify team members** - From repo collaborators, org membership, or PR/issue participants
2. **Collect metrics per member** - PRs authored, PRs merged, reviews given, open review requests
3. **Detect bottlenecks** - PRs waiting 7+ days for review, members with too many pending requests
4. **Render table** - Per-member row with metric summary
5. **Save report** - Written to `.github/reviews/analytics/team-dashboard-{date}.md` and `.html`

### Per-Member Table

```text
Team Dashboard - owner/repo (last 14 days)

Member      PRs authored  PRs merged  Reviews given  Pending requests
         
alice       3             3           8              0
bob         2             1           4              2  <- 1 waiting 7d
charlie     0             0           2              1
diana       4             3           5              0

Bottleneck: #112 "CSV export" - waiting 8 days for bob's review
```

### Bottleneck Detection

A bottleneck is flagged when:

- A PR has waited 7+ days for review by a specific person
- A person has 3+ pending review requests simultaneously
- No reviews given in 7+ days (potential capacity issue)

### Coverage Gaps

The agent also checks for:

- Repos with no recent reviewer activity
- Longtime contributors with no recent commits (potential churn signal)
- Single-contributor repos (bus factor = 1)
