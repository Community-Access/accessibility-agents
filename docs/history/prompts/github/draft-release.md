Generate release notes from merged PRs since the last release. The agent auto-categorizes changes, writes a readable summary, and saves the notes as markdown and HTML.

## When to Use It

- Preparing a GitHub release and writing the description
- After a sprint when you need to document what shipped
- Before tagging a version to build the release notes document first
- Sharing a changelog with stakeholders before a release goes live

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/draft-release owner/repo
```

With an explicit version or base:

```text
/draft-release owner/repo v2.1.0
/draft-release owner/repo since v2.0.0
/draft-release owner/repo since 2026-02-01
```

## What to Expect

1. **Find previous release** - Determines the last published release or tag to use as the baseline
2. **Collect merged PRs** - Fetches all PRs merged since that baseline with titles, authors, and labels
3. **Auto-categorize** - Sorts PRs into 7 categories based on labels and title patterns
4. **Write summary** - Produces a human-readable release description
5. **Save** - Written to `.github/reviews/releases/release-notes-{version}-{date}.md` and `.html`

### Auto-Category Rules

Each category, with its label or title signals.

| Category | Label or title signals |
|----------|----------------------|
| Breaking changes | `breaking`, `breaking-change`, title contains "BREAKING:" |
| New features | `enhancement`, `feature`, title contains "feat:" |
| Bug fixes | `bug`, `fix`, title contains "fix:" |
| Performance | `performance`, `perf`, title contains "perf:" |
| Security | `security`, `vulnerability`, Dependabot PRs |
| Documentation | `documentation`, `docs`, title contains "docs:" |
| Chores | `chore`, `refactor`, `ci`, `dependencies` |
