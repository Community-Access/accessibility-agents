Run a first-time health check on a GitHub repository - produces a structured onboarding report covering code quality signals, open issues, CI health, contributor activity, documentation coverage, and accessibility label presence.

## When to Use It

- Joining a new project and wanting a quick orientation
- Inheriting a repository and assessing its health before work begins
- Reviewing an open-source repo before contributing
- Generating an onboarding artifact to share with new team members

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/onboard-repo owner/repo
```

## What to Expect

1. **Discover repo** - Reads README, license, description, topics, and contributors
2. **Analyze open issues** - Counts, labels, staleness, and response rate
3. **Check CI** - Workflow configs, last run status, and branch protection
4. **Review PR activity** - Merge rate, review cycle time, stale PRs
5. **Documentation check** - README, contributing guide, code of conduct, issue templates
6. **Save report** - Written to `.github/reviews/onboarding/onboard-{repo}-{date}.md` and `.html`
