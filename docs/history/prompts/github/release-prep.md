Walk through an 8-step guided release readiness workflow - milestone closure, PR inclusion, CI verification, security checks, release notes, checklist sign-off, and saved documentation.

## When to Use It

- Planning a release and want a checklist-driven process
- Leading a release review meeting and need a structured walkthrough
- Ensuring all release gates are satisfied before tagging
- Generating a release prep artifact for audit trails

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/release-prep owner/repo v2.1.0
```

Or without a version to auto-detect:

```text
/release-prep owner/repo
```

## What to Expect

The agent walks through 8 steps in sequence, completing each one and confirming before moving to the next.

### Step 1: Milestone Verification

Check if a milestone for the target version exists and is properly configured:

- Issue count open vs. closed
- Any overdue issues that block the milestone
- Recommendation: close, defer, or block the release

### Step 2: PR Inclusion Review

Confirm all intended PRs are merged and nothing critical is still open:

- PRs merged since last release
- Open PRs targeting this release
- PRs in review that may or may not make the cut

### Step 3: CI Verification

Confirm all CI checks are green on the release branch or `main`:

- All required workflow runs passing
- No flaky tests in the last 7 days
- Branch protection status

### Step 4: Security Check

Verify no unpatched critical or high vulnerabilities:

- Open Dependabot alerts by severity
- Pending security-related PRs
- Any known CVEs in dependencies

### Step 5: Release Notes Draft

Generate or review release notes (delegates to `/draft-release`):

- Auto-categorized changes
- Breaking changes prominently surfaced
- Upgrade instructions if needed

### Step 6: Checklist Sign-off

Interactive sign-off checklist:

```text
Release Checklist - v2.1.0:
  [ ] Milestone closed
  [ ] All required PRs merged
  [ ] CI green on main
  [ ] No critical Dependabot alerts
  [ ] Release notes written
  [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
  [ ] Stakeholders notified
```

### Step 7: Save Documentation

Both `.md` and `.html` saved to `.github/reviews/releases/release-prep-{version}-{date}.*`:

- Full checklist sign-off state
- Included PR list
- CI and security summary

### Step 8: Next Actions

After sign-off:

- Tag and publish GitHub Release
- Link release to milestone
- Announce (if configured)
