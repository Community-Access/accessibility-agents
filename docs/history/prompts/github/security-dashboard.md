Show a security alert summary across repositories - Dependabot vulnerability alerts and Renovate PRs - grouped by severity with per-repo tables and remediation recommendations.

## When to Use It

- Weekly security check to find unaddressed Dependabot alerts
- Before a release to verify no critical vulnerabilities are unpatched
- Tracking which repos have the most unresolved security debt
- Getting a quick severity breakdown without navigating each repo's Security tab

## How to Launch It

**In GitHub Copilot Chat:**

```text
/security-dashboard owner/repo
```

For an org:

```text
/security-dashboard org:myorg
```

## What to Expect

1. **Fetch Dependabot alerts** - Queries open vulnerability alerts with severity, package, and CVE
2. **Fetch security-related PRs** - Finds open Dependabot and Renovate PRs
3. **Group by severity** - Critical -> High -> Medium -> Low -> Pending
4. **Render per-repo table** - Each repo shows counts by severity and oldest unfixed alert
5. **Top recommendations** - Calls out critical and high-severity items that need urgent action

### Severity Levels

Each level, with its CVSS range and action.

| Level | CVSS range | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Fix immediately |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Fix this sprint |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Plan for upcoming sprint |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Address when possible |

### Sample Output

```text
Security Dashboard - org:myorg (2 repos)

Repo                  Critical  High  Medium  Low  Pending PRs
          
owner/auth-app        1         2     4       0    3 Dependabot PRs
owner/docs-site       0         0     1       2    0

 Critical - owner/auth-app
  lodash < 4.17.21 - Prototype pollution (CVE-2021-23337)
  Opened 14 days ago - no action taken

High - owner/auth-app  
  semver < 5.7.2 - ReDoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-25883)
  jsonwebtoken <= 8.5.1 - Secret disclosure (CVE-2022-23529)
  Pending Dependabot PR: #104
```

### Dependabot PR Status

The agent also shows:

- Open Dependabot or Renovate PRs and their CI status
- PRs where auto-merge is enabled vs. blocked
- Oldest open security PR (a PR older than 30 days is flagged)

## Example Variations

```text
/security-dashboard owner/repo                # One repo
/security-dashboard org:myorg                 # All org repos
/security-dashboard critical only             # Only critical alerts
/security-dashboard owner/repo with prs       # Include PR list
```
