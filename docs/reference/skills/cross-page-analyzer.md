# cross-page-analyzer

> **Internal sub-agent.** This agent is not user-invokable. It is orchestrated automatically by [web-accessibility-wizard](./web-accessibility-wizard.md) (and the accessibility-lead team) when auditing multiple web pages. You do not need to invoke it directly.

## What It Does

`cross-page-analyzer` receives aggregated scan findings from multiple web page audits and:

1. **Classifies issues** - determines whether each finding is systemic (affects all pages), template-level (affects pages sharing a component), or page-specific (isolated to one page)
2. **Scores each page** - computes a weighted 0-100 accessibility risk score with an A-F grade
3. **Generates a cross-page comparison scorecard** - a table showing all pages side-by-side with scores and issue counts
4. **Tracks remediation progress** - when a baseline is provided, classifies each finding as Fixed, New, Persistent, or Regressed

## When It Runs

The `web-accessibility-wizard` calls this agent during multi-page audits:

- `audit-web-multi-page` prompt - after scanning 2+ pages
- `compare-web-audits` prompt - when comparing two audit reports across time
- Full site audits triggered by the accessibility-lead in a comprehensive review

## Scoring Formula

The agent computes a risk score for each page:

```text
Page Score = 100 - (sum of weighted findings)
Minimum score: 0
```

| Severity | Confidence | Deduction |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Critical | High (confirmed by both axe-core and code review) | -15 points |
| Critical | High (single source) | -10 points |
| Critical | Medium | -7 points |
| Serious | High | -7 points |
| Serious | Medium | -5 points |
| Moderate | High | -3 points |
| Moderate | Medium | -2 points |
| Minor | Any | -1 point |

The double-source multiplier for Critical issues (+5 deduction) reflects that axe-core findings confirmed by manual code review have very high confidence and almost always represent real barriers for users of assistive technology.

### Grade Table

Each score, with its grade and meaning.

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | A | Excellent - meets WCAG AA |
| 75-89 | B | Good - mostly meets WCAG AA |
| 50-74 | C | Needs Work - partial compliance |
| 25-49 | D | Poor - significant barriers |
| 0-24 | F | Failing - unusable with assistive technology |

## Issue Classification

The agent examines which issues appear across multiple pages and assigns each a type:

| Type | Definition | Fix Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Systemic | The same issue appears on every audited page | Fix the shared layout template, navigation component, or global CSS - highest ROI |
| Template-level | The issue appears on pages that share a specific component | Fix that shared component |
| Page-specific | The issue is unique to one page | Fix individually |

**Why this matters:** A systemic issue fixed in `<Header />` or `<Footer />` disappears from every page at once. Fixing the highest-impact systemic issues first produces the greatest accessibility improvement per hour of engineering work.

## Comparison Scorecard

For a 5-page audit, the agent produces a scorecard table like:

| Page | Score | Grade | Critical | Serious | Moderate | Minor |
|------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Home | 72 | C | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| Product detail | 88 | B | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Checkout step 1 | 61 | C | 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 |
| Checkout step 2 | 58 | C | 3 | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| Account settings | 91 | A | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

This scorecard appears in the audit report and in commit comments when the wizard posts results to a pull request.

## Remediation Tracking

When baseline report data is provided, every finding is classified:

| Classification | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Fixed | Present in baseline, absent in current scan |
| New | Absent in baseline, present in current scan |
| Persistent | Present in both scans |
| Regressed | A previously Fixed issue has returned |

The `compare-web-audits` prompt surfaces this classification to users as a progress overview: "12 Fixed, 3 New, 8 Persistent, 1 Regressed."

## Playwright-Enhanced Analysis

When Playwright behavioral testing data is available from `playwright-scanner`, the cross-page analyzer gains two additional capabilities:

### Accessibility Tree Diffing

Compares browser accessibility tree snapshots across pages to detect:

- **Landmark consistency** — Same landmarks present on every page (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo)
- **Heading level consistency** — Same content types use consistent heading levels across pages
- **ARIA label consistency** — Same landmarks labeled consistently (not "Main navigation" on one page, "Nav" on another)
- **Role drift** — Same components maintaining consistent roles across pages

Produces a **structural consistency score** (0-100) where 100 means all pages share identical structure.

### Keyboard Flow Comparison

Compares tab-order sequences across pages to detect:

- **Navigation order consistency** — Shared nav elements in same relative tab order
- **Trap aggregation** — Keyboard traps classified as systemic vs page-specific
- **Tab count variance** — Pages with dramatically different tab stop counts flagged
- **Focus management patterns** — How focus handles route changes across pages

## Connections

Each component, with its role.
