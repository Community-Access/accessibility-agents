## What This Agent Is For

The issue-tracker agent is your full-service GitHub issues workplace. It replaces the GitHub.com issues tab with something smarter: it does not just list your issues, it *thinks* about them - deduplicates, cross-references linked PRs and discussions, scores priority, and tells you which ones are silently blocking other work.

Beyond reading issues, it handles the complete lifecycle:

- Create issues from scratch or templates
- Comment, reply to specific comments, and batch-reply across multiple issues
- Manage labels, assignees, milestones, and state
- Add reactions to build community engagement
- Generate VPAT-ready reports documenting your issue history

Use issue-tracker when:

- You want to triage a backlog and get a priority-sorted action list
- You want to deep-dive into a specific issue's full thread history
- You want to reply to issues or comments without leaving the editor
- You need to create a batch of issues from a list, an audit report, or a meeting
- You want to generate a report of your issue status for a stakeholder

| `create issue - users cannot tab into the date picker` | Create a new issue |
| `thumbs up #42` / `react to #42` | Add a reaction |
| `add label "bug" to #42` | Manage labels |
| `assign @alice to #42` | Assign the issue |

## What to Expect - Step by Step

### Triage Mode

1. **Scope detection.** The agent reads `preferences.md` to determine which repos to search and which label filters to apply. Defaults to all your repos for the last 30 days.

2. **Progress collection.**

   ```text
    Searching issues across your repos…
    Found 38 open issues: 6 assigned to you, 12 @mentions, 20 to monitor
   ```

3. **Priority scoring.** Each issue is ranked using:
   - Days open (older = higher priority)
   - Label signals (`critical`, `blocker`, `regression` score up; `nice-to-have` scores down)
   - Reaction count (a11y community signal)
   - Comment velocity (active discussion = higher priority)
   - PR linkage (a linked open PR elevates the issue)

4. **Dashboard output.** A triage table is shown in chat and saved as a workspace document:

   | Priority | Issue | Age | Labels | Linked PRs |
   |----------|-------|-----|--------|-----------|
   |  Critical | #87 Focus lost after delete | 14d | `a11y`, `regression` | - |
   |  High | #64 Contrast fails on dark mode | 8d | `a11y`, `needs-fix` | #88 |

5. **Action prompts.** After the dashboard, the agent offers: "Reply to the top issue?" "Create tasks from this list?" "Add to tomorrow's briefing?"

### Deep Dive Mode

1. Pulls the complete issue thread: title, body, all comments, timeline events, linked PRs, linked discussions
2. Shows a structured summary: what the issue reports, what has been tried, what the current status is, who is waiting on whom
3. Drafts a response if you ask for one
4. Shows reaction summary so you can gauge community interest

### Create Mode

The agent guides you through creating a high-quality issue:

1. Asks for the repository (defaults to workspace repo)
2. Checks existing issues for duplicates before creating
3. Suggests labels based on the content
4. Recommends assignees based on the area of code
5. Previews the issue before posting

## Priority Scoring Explained

<details>
<summary>Expand priority scoring signals</summary>

The issue-tracker scores each issue on a 0-100 scale based on multiple signals:

| Signal | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Days open | High | Issues >30d flagged as stale |
| Critical/blocker label | High | Instant top-of-queue |
| Assigned to you | High | Always in your personal queue |
| @mentions | Medium | Your name in comments or body |
| Reaction count | Medium | Community weight indicator |
| Comment velocity (last 3d) | Medium | Fresh activity = likely needs response |
| Linked open PR | Medium | Elevates - someone is working on it |
| Milestone due date | High if <7d | Deadline pressure |
| `wontfix` / `duplicate` label | Negative | Demoted in triage |

## Behavioral Constraints

<details>
<summary>Expand constraints</summary>

- Never posts a comment without showing a preview first
- Always checks for duplicates before creating a new issue
- Label operations always show current labels before and after changes
- Close operations always confirm: "Close #42 as [reason]?" before acting
- Priority scores are always shown with the signals that drove the score - never a mystery number
- Searching "my issues" searches across all configured repos, not just the workspace repo

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Show troubleshooting help</summary>

**"It only found issues in my current repo."**
Add a `preferences.md` with `repos.discovery: all` to search all your repos. Or say: "search all my repos for issues assigned to me."

**"It created a duplicate issue."**
The agent checks for duplicates before creating. If a duplicate passed through, it means the existing issue had different wording. Try: "search for existing issues about [topic] first, then create one if none exist."

**"I want to use a saved search filter."**
Define named searches in `preferences.md` under `search.saved_searches`. Then say: `search a11y-critical` and it will expand the filter automatically.
