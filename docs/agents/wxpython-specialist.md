# wxpython-specialist - wxPython GUI Expert

> wxPython GUI expert -- sizer layouts, event handling, AUI framework, custom controls, threading (wx.CallAfter/wx.PostEvent), dialog design, menu/toolbar construction, and desktop accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation). Covers cross-platform gotchas for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## When to Use It

- Building or fixing wxPython GUI layouts with sizers
- Handling events, custom events, or UI update events
- Working with AUI (Advanced User Interface) panes and docking
- Creating dialogs, menus, toolbars, or accelerator tables
- Threading in wxPython (wx.CallAfter, wx.PostEvent, wx.Timer)
- Making wxPython controls accessible to screen readers
- Fixing keyboard event handling that fails with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
- Auditing wxPython code for accessibility issues

## What It Does NOT Do

- Does not handle pure Python language issues unrelated to wxPython (routes to python-specialist)
- Does not implement platform accessibility APIs directly (routes to desktop-a11y-specialist)
- Does not perform screen reader testing (routes to desktop-a11y-testing-coach)

## Screen Reader Key Event Pitfalls

The agent includes dedicated guidance on why `EVT_KEY_DOWN` and `EVT_CHAR` silently fail when screen readers like NVDA or JAWS are active on list, tree, and data view controls. It recommends `EVT_CHAR_HOOK` (which fires at the top-level window before the native control handler) and semantic activation events (`EVT_LIST_ITEM_ACTIVATED`, `EVT_TREE_ITEM_ACTIVATED`) as reliable alternatives.

## Accessibility Audit Mode

When asked to audit a wxPython project for accessibility, the agent uses 14 structured detection rules (WX-A11Y-001 through WX-A11Y-014) covering:

| Rule Range | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| WX-A11Y-001..003 | Critical: Missing SetName(), no AcceleratorTable, mouse-only events |
| WX-A11Y-004..006 | Serious: Dialog UX, focus on ShowModal, bitmap labels |
| WX-A11Y-007..009 | Moderate: Color-only state, silent status changes, custom-drawn panels |
| WX-A11Y-010..012 | Minor/Moderate: Tab order, virtual lists, menu accelerators |
| WX-A11Y-013..014 | Critical/Serious: EVT_KEY_DOWN/EVT_CHAR on list/tree controls (fails with screen readers), missing semantic event bindings |

Returns a structured report with file, line number, and concrete code fix for each finding.

## Example Prompts

- "Fix my sizer layout -- controls aren't expanding"
- "Add keyboard shortcuts to my app"
- "Make this dialog accessible to screen readers"
- "Enter key doesn't work on my ListBox when NVDA is running"
- "Audit this wxPython project for accessibility"
- "Help me with AUI pane management"
- "My app crashes when I update the GUI from a thread"
