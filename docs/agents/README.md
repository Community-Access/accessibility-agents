# Agent Reference

This directory contains detailed documentation for every agent in the A11y Agent Team. Each agent has its own page with full usage examples, behavioral constraints, and what it catches.

## How Agents Work - The Mental Model

Think of the A11y Agent Team as a consulting team of accessibility specialists. You do not need to know which specialist to call - that is the lead's job. But you *can* call any specialist directly when you already know what you need.

**The Accessibility Lead** is your single point of contact. Tell it what you are building or reviewing, and it will figure out which specialists are needed, invoke them, and compile the findings. If you only remember one agent name, remember this one.

**The nine code specialists** (ARIA Specialist, Modal Specialist, Contrast Master, Keyboard Navigator, Live Region Controller, Forms Specialist, Alt Text & Headings, Tables Specialist, Link Checker) each own one domain of web accessibility. They write code, review code, and report issues within their area. They do not overlap - each has a clear boundary.

**The six document specialists** (Word Accessibility, Excel Accessibility, PowerPoint Accessibility, office-scan-config, PDF Accessibility, pdf-scan-config) scan Office and PDF documents for accessibility issues.

**The Web Accessibility Wizard** runs interactive guided web audits. It walks you through your entire project phase by phase, asks questions to understand your context, invokes the right specialists at each step, and produces a prioritized action plan with an accessibility scorecard.

**The Document Accessibility Wizard** does the same for Office and PDF documents, with cross-document analysis, severity scoring, remediation tracking, and VPAT/ACR compliance export.

**The Markdown Accessibility** agent audits Markdown documentation files across 9 accessibility domains: links, alt text, headings, tables, emoji, diagrams, em-dashes, anchor links, and plain language. It runs per-file parallel scans via `markdown-scanner` and applies fixes via `markdown-fixer`.

**The Testing Coach** does not write product code. It teaches you how to test what the other agents built.

**The WCAG Guide** does not write or review code. It explains the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in plain language.

## Invocation Syntax

<details>
<summary>Expand invocation syntax reference</summary>

### Claude Code (Terminal)

| Method | Syntax | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Slash command | `/accessibility-lead review this page` | Direct invocation from the prompt |
| At-mention | `@accessibility-lead review this page` | Alternative syntax, same behavior |
| List agents | `/agents` | See all installed agents |

### Codex CLI (Terminal)

| Method | Syntax | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Automatic | Rules apply to every UI task | No invocation needed — Codex reads `.codex/AGENTS.md` automatically |

Codex CLI does not have named agents or sub-agents. All accessibility rules are condensed into a single `AGENTS.md` file that Codex loads on every run. There is nothing to invoke — the rules are always active.

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code / Editor)

> **Note:** Custom agents must first be selected from the **agent picker dropdown** (the model/agent selector at the top of the Chat panel). After selecting an agent from the picker once, it will appear in `@` autocomplete for future use.

| Method | Syntax | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Agent picker | Select from dropdown at top of Chat panel | First-time activation of any custom agent |
| At-mention in Chat | `@Accessibility Lead review this page` | Direct invocation after first picker selection |
| With file context | Select code, then `@ARIA Specialist check this` | Review selected code |
| Workspace instructions | Automatic - loaded on every conversation | Ensures accessibility guidance is always present |

## GitHub Workflow Agents

These agents manage your GitHub repositories, pull requests, issues, and team - the "operating system" layer of a healthy software project. They live alongside the accessibility team but handle an entirely different job: keeping your GitHub world organized, actionable, and fast to navigate.

### The Mental Model

**GitHub Hub** is your single entry point. You never need to know which agent to call. Just describe what you want - "review the PR from this morning," "who's waiting on me?" "onboard our new developer" - and GitHub Hub figures out the rest, asks any clarifying questions intelligently, and routes you to the right specialist with context already loaded.

The ten specialist agents each own a vertical slice of GitHub operations:

- **Daily Briefing** owns the *morning picture* - what happened, what needs action
- **PR Review** owns *code review* - diffs, comments, merge decisions
- **Issue Tracker** owns *issue work* - triage, response, management
- **Analytics & Insights** owns *data* - velocity, bottlenecks, health scores
- **Accessibility Tracker** owns *accessibility change tracking* - VS Code + your repos
- **Repo Admin** owns *access control* - who can do what, branch protection, settings
- **Team Manager** owns *people* - onboarding, offboarding, org teams
- **Contributions Hub** owns *community* - discussions, health, contributor relationships
- **Template Builder** owns *GitHub templates* - issue/PR/discussion templates via guided wizard
- **Repo Manager** owns *repo scaffolding* - CI, labels, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, README

### Invocation

| Platform | Syntax |
|----------|--------|
| GitHub Copilot (VS Code) | `@GitHub Hub what needs my attention today?` |
| GitHub Copilot (VS Code) | `@Daily Briefing morning briefing` |
| Claude Code (Terminal) | `/github-hub show my open PRs` |
| Claude Code (Terminal) | `/pr-review owner/repo#42` |

You can invoke any agent directly if you know exactly what you need. Or start at `@github-hub` and let it route you.

### When to Use GitHub Workflow Agents vs. Accessibility Agents

## Parallel Agentic Flow

Multi-agent workflows run parallel execution to minimize wait time. Knowing the model helps you understand why responses arrive in bursts.

### Web Accessibility Parallel Groups

When `web-accessibility-wizard` runs a full audit, specialists execute in three simultaneous groups:

| Group | Agents Running in Parallel |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Group 1** | `aria-specialist` + `keyboard-navigator` + `forms-specialist` |
| **Group 2** | `contrast-master` + `alt-text-headings` + `link-checker` |
| **Group 3** | `modal-specialist` + `live-region-controller` + `tables-data-specialist` |

All three groups run simultaneously. `cross-page-analyzer` then synthesizes results across groups. This is why a full web audit produces all findings at once rather than one specialist at a time.

### Document Accessibility Parallel Groups

When `document-accessibility-wizard` scans a folder, it distributes by type:

| Type | Agent |
|------|-------|
| `.docx` files | `word-accessibility` |
| `.xlsx` files | `excel-accessibility` |
| `.pptx` files | `powerpoint-accessibility` |
| `.pdf` files   | `pdf-accessibility` |
| `.epub` files  | `epub-accessibility` |

All four type-specialist streams run simultaneously. `cross-document-analyzer` then runs cross-document pattern detection after all scans complete.

### Markdown Accessibility Parallel Groups

When `markdown-a11y-assistant` runs an audit, it dispatches `markdown-scanner` for each file simultaneously:

| What Runs in Parallel | Details |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Per-file `markdown-scanner` calls | One scanner per `.md` file, all running concurrently |
| 9 domain checks per file | Links, alt text, headings, tables, emoji, diagrams, em-dashes, anchors, plain language |

`markdown-fixer` then runs sequentially by file, applying auto-fixable items and surfacing human-judgment items for review.

### GitHub Workflow Parallel Streams

`daily-briefing` runs Batch 1 streams simultaneously:

| Stream | Agent Function |
|--------|---------------|
| Issues | Open issues, @mentions, triage queue |
| PRs | Review requests, authored PRs, CI status |
| Security/CI | Dependabot alerts, failing checks |
| A11y | Latest VS Code Insiders accessibility commits |

`analytics` collects its 5 data streams in parallel: PR metrics, issue metrics, contribution activity, code churn, and bottleneck detection.

### Progress Announcements

Every long-running agent operation narrates its steps aloud. The pattern is universal across all agent teams:

```text
 Starting [operation]…
 Complete - [N items] found
```

You will always know what is happening and when each phase finishes. This is required behavior - no agent silently collects data.

## Agent Tool Reference

Every agent declares which tools it can use in its YAML frontmatter. This determines what capabilities each agent has at runtime - whether it can read files, edit code, run terminal commands, invoke sub-agents, or interact with GitHub APIs.

### Tool Glossary

| Tool Name | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `read` / `readFile` | Read file contents from the workspace |
| `search` / `textSearch` | Search for text patterns across the workspace |
| `fileSearch` | Search for files by name or glob pattern |
| `edit` / `editFiles` | Modify existing files in the workspace |
| `createFile` | Create new files |
| `createDirectory` | Create new directories |
| `listDirectory` | List directory contents |
| `runInTerminal` / `getTerminalOutput` | Execute terminal commands and read output |
| `runSubagent` / `agent` | Invoke sub-agents for delegation |
| `askQuestions` / `ask_questions` | Prompt the user for clarification or input |
| `fetch` | Fetch content from URLs |
| `codebase` | Semantic search across the codebase |
| `github/*` | GitHub API operations (issues, PRs, repos, teams, etc.) |

**Notes:**
- **accessibility-lead** is the only web specialist with `runSubagent` - it orchestrates the others.
- **testing-coach** has no `edit` - it teaches testing techniques but does not write product code.
- **wcag-guide** has no `edit` or `runInTerminal` - it is a pure reference agent.
- **link-checker** has no `runInTerminal` - it works by reading and searching source files only.
- **design-system-auditor** has no tools declared in frontmatter (likely an omission - it references `askQuestions` in its body).

**Notes:**
- All GitHub agents have `github/*` (GitHub API access), `createFile`, `createDirectory`, and `listDirectory` for report output.
- **repo-manager** has the widest tool set - it needs full workspace access for scaffolding repos.
- **nexus** and **github-hub** are functionally identical orchestrators (nexus is the canonical name).
- **template-builder** is the only GitHub agent without `fetch` - it works with local template files only.

</details>

## Environment Parity

Agents exist in three environments. Claude Code and Copilot have full multi-agent support. Codex CLI uses a single condensed ruleset.

| Property | GitHub Copilot | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Agent directory | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.codex/AGENTS.md` (single file) |

## Tips for Getting the Best Results

<details>
<summary>Expand tips for effective agent use</summary>

**Be specific about context.** Instead of "review this file," say "review the modal in this file for focus trapping and escape behavior." Specific prompts activate the right specialist knowledge.

**Name the component type.** Instead of "check this code," say "check this combobox" or "review this sortable data table." Component type maps directly to specialist expertise.

**Ask for audits when you want breadth.** Use the accessibility-lead for broad reviews. Use individual specialists when you know exactly what domain you are concerned about.

**Chain specialists for complex components.** A modal with a form inside it? Invoke modal-specialist for the overlay behavior and forms-specialist for the form content. Or just use accessibility-lead and let it coordinate.

**Use testing-coach after building.** The code specialists help you write correct code. Testing-coach helps you verify it actually works. These are different activities.

**Use wcag-guide when debating.** If your team disagrees about what WCAG requires, ask wcag-guide. It gives definitive answers with criterion references, not opinions.
