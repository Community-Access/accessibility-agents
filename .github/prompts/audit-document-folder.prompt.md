# Folder Document Accessibility Audit

Run a comprehensive recursive accessibility audit on all documents in the folder below. Use the **document-accessibility-wizard** agent.

## Target folder

**Path:** `${input:folderPath}`

## Settings

- **Scan mode:** Folder (recursive - include all subfolders)
- **Document types:** All supported (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .pdf)
- **Scan profile:** Moderate (errors and warnings - skip tips for speed)
- **Report path:** `DOCUMENT-ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`
- **Organization:** By file
- **Remediation steps:** Summary only

## Instructions

1. Discover all documents recursively in the folder
2. Skip temp files (~$*, *.tmp, *.bak) and ignored directories (.git, node_modules)
3. Present the inventory with counts by type and subfolder
4. Ask for confirmation before scanning
5. Scan all files, delegating each to the appropriate sub-agent
6. Run cross-document pattern analysis
7. Compute severity scores for every file
8. Detect shared templates and flag template-level issues
9. Build the metadata dashboard
10. Generate the full report with scorecard
11. Offer follow-up actions

## Handoff Transparency

This workflow delegates to format-specific sub-agents for each document. Announce transitions:
- **Per file:** "Scanning file [N/total]: [filename] using [agent-name]..."
- **Per completion:** "[filename]: [N] findings, score [score]/100"
- **Cross-analysis:** "Running cross-document analysis on [N] files..."
- **On failure:** "Scan failed for [filename]: [reason]. Continuing with remaining files."
