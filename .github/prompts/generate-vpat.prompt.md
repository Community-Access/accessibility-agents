# Generate VPAT / Accessibility Conformance Report

Convert a document accessibility audit report into a formal **VPAT 2.5 Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)**.

## Source audit report

**Path:** `${input:auditReportPath}`

## Instructions

Use the **document-accessibility-wizard** agent to:

1. Read the audit report at the specified path
2. Ask which VPAT edition to generate:
   - **WCAG** - WCAG 2.2 criteria only
   - **Section 508** - Revised Section 508 standards
   - **EN 301 549** - European accessibility standard
   - **International** - All three combined
3. Map each finding to its WCAG success criterion
4. For each WCAG criterion, determine the conformance level:
   - **Supports** - zero findings for this criterion
   - **Partially Supports** - some documents pass, some fail
   - **Does Not Support** - all/most documents fail
   - **Not Applicable** - criterion does not apply to document types scanned
5. Generate the VPAT in markdown format with:
   - Product information section
   - Evaluation methods section
   - Full criteria table with conformance levels and remarks
   - Notes and evaluation methodology
6. Write to `VPAT-DOCUMENT-ACCESSIBILITY.md`

## Handoff Transparency

Announce VPAT generation progress:

- **Start:** "Generating VPAT 2.5 compliance report from audit data..."
- **Completion:** "VPAT report written to [path] - [N] criteria evaluated"
- **On failure:** "VPAT generation failed: [reason]. Check that the audit report exists and is valid."
