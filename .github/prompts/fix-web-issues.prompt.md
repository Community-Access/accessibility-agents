# Fix Web Accessibility Issues

Interactive fix mode - reads a previous audit report and applies fixes. Auto-fixable issues are applied automatically; human-judgment issues are presented one at a time for approval.

## Instructions

Use the **web-accessibility-wizard** agent's interactive fix mode:

1. Use askQuestions to ask:
   - "What is the path to the audit report?" - default: `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`
   - "What fix mode do you want?"
     - **Fix all auto-fixable issues** - apply safe fixes without asking
     - **Fix issues one by one** - show each fix, let me approve or skip
     - **Fix a specific issue** - let me pick by issue number

2. Read the audit report and categorize issues:

   **Auto-fixable (safe to apply):**
   - Missing `lang` attribute -> add `lang="en"`
   - Missing viewport meta -> add responsive viewport
   - `<img>` without `alt` -> add `alt=""` for decorative
   - Positive `tabindex` values -> replace with `tabindex="0"`
   - `outline: none` without alternative -> add focus-visible styles
   - Missing `<label>` -> add label with `for` attribute
   - Missing `scope` on `<th>` -> add `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`
   - Missing `autocomplete` -> add appropriate value
   - New tab links without warning -> add visually hidden text

   **Human-judgment (present for approval):**
   - Alt text content for meaningful images
   - Heading hierarchy restructuring
   - Link text rewriting
   - ARIA role assignment
   - Live region placement

3. Apply fixes using the detected framework's syntax (React JSX, Vue template, Angular template, etc.)

4. After all fixes, if a URL is available, re-run axe-core to verify:

   ```bash
   npx @axe-core/cli <URL> --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa,wcag21a,wcag21aa
   ```

5. Report results:

   ```text
   Fixes Applied: [count]
   Verified by re-scan: [count passed] / [count total]
   Issues remaining: [count] (require manual attention)
   
   Updated score: [previous] -> [current] ([+/-] points)
   ```

6. Update the audit report with a "Fixes Applied" section.

## Handoff Transparency

This workflow delegates to the `web-issue-fixer` sub-agent. Announce transitions:

- **Before delegation:** "Applying [N] fixes to [N] files ([N] auto-fixable, [N] need approval)"
- **Per fix:** Show the issue, before/after code, and result
- **After completion:** "Fix pass complete: [N] applied, [N] skipped, [N] pending approval"
- **On failure:** "Fix failed for [file]: [reason]. File left unchanged."
