# Compare Web Accessibility Audits

Compare two web accessibility audit reports to track remediation progress over time. Shows which issues were fixed, which are new, which persist, and which regressed.

## Instructions

Use the **web-accessibility-wizard** agent's remediation tracking capabilities:

1. Use askQuestions to ask:
   - "What is the path to the **previous** audit report?" - default: `ACCESSIBILITY-AUDIT.md`
   - "What is the path to the **current** audit report (or should I run a new audit)?"
     - Options: "Use an existing report" (let me provide the path) | "Run a new audit now"

2. If running a new audit, ask for the URL and run a standard audit first.

3. Parse both reports and classify every finding:
   - **Fixed** - in previous report but not in current
   - **New** - in current report but not in previous
   - **Persistent** - in both reports
   - **Regressed** - was fixed (not in a mid-point report) but has returned

4. Generate the comparison report:

```markdown
# Accessibility Remediation Progress

## Summary

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Total Issues | [n] | [n] | [+/-n] |
| Critical | [n] | [n] | [+/-n] |
| Serious | [n] | [n] | [+/-n] |
| Overall Score | [n]/100 | [n]/100 | [+/-n] |

## Progress: [X]% of previous issues resolved

### Fixed Issues ([count])
[List with celebration - these are wins]

### New Issues ([count])
[List - these need attention]

### Persistent Issues ([count])
[List - prioritize these for next sprint]

### Regressed Issues ([count])
[List - investigate why these returned]

## Trend
[Improving / Stable / Declining] - [one sentence assessment]
```

5. Ask: "Want to focus on fixing the persistent issues now?"

## Handoff Transparency

Announce audit comparison progress:

- **Start:** "Comparing [report1] with [report2] - analyzing [N] findings..."
- **Completion:** "Comparison complete: [N] fixed, [N] new, [N] persistent, [N] regressed"
- **On failure:** "Could not parse [report]: [reason]. Comparison aborted."
