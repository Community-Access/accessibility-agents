Generate a production-ready accessibility bug report template for your GitHub repository.

${input:customization:Optional: any customization -- e.g. 'add a field for our component names: Sidebar, Header, Modal', 'use our labels: a11y, triage', 'include a field for our app version' -- or leave blank to use the standard template}

## Steps

### Step 1: Confirm Customization

If customization was provided, incorporate it. If not, check one thing:
- Ask: "Should the Component field list your specific component names, or use free text?" (Use #tool:ask_questions with options: "Free text is fine" / "Let me add our component names")
- If they want to add component names, collect them.

### Step 2: Check for Existing Templates

Use #tool:listDirectory to inspect `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- If an `accessibility` or `a11y` template already exists, warn the user and offer to overwrite or rename.

### Step 3: Generate the Template

Produce this complete accessibility bug report template, incorporating any customizations:

```yaml
name: Accessibility Bug Report
description: Report a screen reader, keyboard navigation, or visual accessibility issue
title: "[A11Y] "
labels: ["accessibility", "bug"]
body:

        Thank you for helping make this project more accessible. Please provide as much detail as you can -- it helps us reproduce and fix the issue faster.

        **Not sure if this is an accessibility issue?** If someone using a screen reader, keyboard, or other assistive technology would find it harder to use -- it belongs here.

### Step 4: Apply Customizations and Save

1. Apply any field customizations requested (component names, custom labels, app-specific version numbers, etc.).
2. Show the complete final template.
3. Confirm before saving.
4. Use #tool:createDirectory to ensure `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` exists.
5. Use #tool:createFile to save as `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/accessibility-bug.yml`.
6. Confirm: _"Accessibility bug template saved to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/accessibility-bug.yml`"_

### Step 5: Offer Next Steps

- "Want to test it by opening a new issue in your repo?"
- "Want to add this template to your `config.yml` chooser?"
- "Want to also add a `good first issue` label for newcomers to help with accessibility fixes?"
- "Use `@contributions-hub` to check your overall community health, including template coverage."
