Add targeted review comments to specific lines in a pull request.

${input:pr:PR reference -- e.g. owner/repo#123 or a GitHub PR URL}

## Steps

1. Parse the PR reference to extract owner, repo, and PR number.
2. Fetch changed files with #tool:mcp_github_github_pull_request_read (method: `get_files`).
3. Also check release context -- note if this PR is release-bound so the user can prioritize blocking vs. non-blocking comments.
4. Use #tool:ask_questions to present the changed files as selectable options -- include filename, change type, risk level, and changes stats for each option.
5. Show the annotated diff for the selected file with dual line numbers (old/new) and the Change Map table (hunk summary with line ranges and intent). The user picks a line from the numbered output.
6. Collect from the user:
   - **Line(s):** single line or range using L-number format (e.g., "L42" or "L42-L50")
   - **Side:** new code (RIGHT) or old code (LEFT) -- default to RIGHT
   - **Comment:** what to say
   - **Priority level:** CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, SUGGESTION, NIT, or PRAISE (per code review standards)
7. Preview the comment with surrounding numbered lines from the diff:
   > **Comment on `{file}` L{N} -- {PRIORITY}:**
   > ```
   > {N-2} | {context line}
   > {N-1} | {context line}
   > {N}   | {target line}  <-- your comment here
   > {N+1} | {context line}
   > {N+2} | {context line}
   > ```
   > {comment text}
8. Use #tool:ask_questions: **Submit**, **Edit**, **Add another comment first**, **Cancel**.
9. Create a pending review --> add comment(s) --> when ready, ask for review event:
   - **Approve** -- looks good
   - **Request Changes** -- needs work
   - **Comment Only** -- feedback without formal verdict
10. Submit with #tool:mcp_github_github_pull_request_review_write (method: `submit_pending`).
11. Confirm with a link to the submitted review.

**Batch mode:** If the user wants to comment on multiple files, loop steps 4-7 before submitting once.

**Release awareness:** If the PR is release-bound, remind the user to separate blocking issues from nice-to-haves for the release.
