# Markdown Accessibility Review Guidelines

When reviewing or generating markdown files, check for all of the following accessibility issues. Flag violations and suggest fixes with clear explanations of the accessibility impact. These rules extend GitHub's [5 tips for making your GitHub profile page accessible](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/5-tips-for-making-your-github-profile-page-accessible/) with table, diagram, typographic, and anchor-link rules.

**For guided interactive audits**, use the `markdown-a11y-assistant` agent which orchestrates `markdown-scanner` and `markdown-fixer` sub-agents with parallel scanning and a full review gate.

## 1. Descriptive Links (WCAG 2.4.4)

- Flag generic link text: "click here," "here," "this," "read more," "learn more," "link," "view," "see more," "more."
- Link text must make sense when read out of context - assistive technology presents links as an isolated list.
- Flag multiple links on the same page with identical text pointing to different destinations.
- Bare URLs in prose must be converted to descriptive links.
- Do not flag: badge image links, section anchor links using the section name, or links inside code blocks.

Bad: `Read my blog post [here](https://example.com)`
Good: `Read my blog post "[Crafting an accessible resume](https://example.com)"`

## 2. Image Alt Text (WCAG 1.1.1)

- Flag images with empty alt text (`![]()`) unless they are explicitly decorative.
- Flag alt text that is a filename (e.g., `img_1234.jpg`) or generic placeholder (`screenshot`, `image`, `photo`).
- Alt text should be succinct and descriptive. Include any text visible in the image.
- Use "screenshot of" where relevant; do not prefix with "image of" as screen readers announce that automatically.
- For complex images (charts, infographics): flag and suggest a `<details>` block with a data summary.
- Always present alt text improvements as recommendations for the author to review - never auto-apply.

## 3. Heading Hierarchy (WCAG 1.3.1 / 2.4.6)

- One H1 (`#`) per document, used as the page title.
- Never skip heading levels: `##` followed by `####` is a violation.
- Flag bold text (`**text**`) used as a visual substitute for a heading.
- Documents with no H1 should have the first major heading promoted.

## 4. Table Accessibility (WCAG 1.3.1)

- Tables without a preceding description or caption are an accessibility gap. Add a one-sentence summary immediately before the table.
- Flag tables where the first column acts as row headers but is not visually distinguishable - suggest bolding first-column cells or restructuring as a definition list.
- Flag tables with more than 6 columns or significant merged-cell complexity - suggest splitting or using a list.
- Tables used for layout (not data) must be replaced with CSS-equivalent structure (lists, paragraphs).
- Do not use `|` pipe characters to create decorative separators outside of table syntax.

Example - add a table summary:

```markdown
The following table lists agents with their role and supported platform.

| Agent | Role | Platform |
|-------|------|----------|
```

## 5. Emoji (WCAG 1.3.3 / Cognitive)

Screen readers read full emoji names aloud ("face with stuck-out tongue and squinting eyes"). Emoji as bullets break list semantics.

Default behavior (remove-decorative mode):

- Flag consecutive emoji sequences (2 or more in a row) - auto-fix by removing.
- Flag emoji used as the first character of a list item - auto-fix by removing and keeping the text.
- Flag emoji in headings - auto-fix by removing.
- Flag single inline emoji that conveys meaning not in surrounding text - suggest removal or word replacement.
- When removing meaning-bearing emoji, preserve the meaning in text.

**Translate mode** (when user requests English translations instead of removal):

- Replace each emoji with its parenthesized English equivalent: `🚀` -> `(Launch)`, `✅` -> `(Done)`, `⚠️` -> `(Warning)`, `💡` -> `(Tip)`, `🔧` -> `(Configuration)`.
- For unknown emoji, flag for human review.
- Default mode is removal, not translation. Only translate when the user explicitly requests it.

## 6. Mermaid and ASCII Diagrams (WCAG 1.1.1 / 1.3.1)

Both Mermaid diagrams and ASCII art render without accessible text alternatives for screen reader users.

**Mermaid diagrams:**

- Flag every ` ```mermaid ` block that does not have a text description immediately before it.
- For replacement: add a text description, then wrap the original Mermaid source in `<details>` so sighted users retain the visual:

```markdown
The following diagram shows a linear flow: Start leads to Process, then to End.

<details>
<summary>Diagram source (Mermaid)</summary>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Process] --> C[End]
```

</details>
```

- Simple diagrams (`graph`, `flowchart`, `pie`, `gantt`): auto-generate a description from node labels and connections.
- Complex diagrams (`sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `erDiagram`): generate a draft description and ask the author to verify accuracy before applying.

**ASCII art diagrams:**

- Flag any ASCII art block (combinations of `+`, `-`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `^`, `v`, `*` forming a visual structure) without a preceding text description.
- For replacement: add a text description (author must provide or approve), then move the ASCII art into a `<details>` block to preserve it for sighted users.
- Never silently remove ASCII art - always preserve it in the collapsed `<details>` block.

## 7. Em-Dash and En-Dash Normalization (Cognitive / Readability)

- Em-dashes (`—`, `--` used as em-dash, or `---` in prose) are read inconsistently by screen readers.
- Recommended fix: replace with ` - ` (space-hyphen-space) in prose.
- Never modify: content inside code blocks or inline code, YAML front matter, HTML comments, or standalone `---` horizontal rules.

Before: `The process takes 2--4 hours—depending on configuration.`
After: `The process takes 2 - 4 hours - depending on configuration.`

## 8. Anchor Link Validation (WCAG 2.4.4)

- Broken anchor links (`[text](#nonexistent-section)`) silently fail - users are dropped at top of page with no error.
- Validate all `[text](#anchor)` links against headings in the same file.
- GitHub anchor generation rules: lowercase everything, replace spaces with hyphens, remove all non-alphanumeric characters except hyphens.
  - `## My Heading` -> `#my-heading`
  - `## API: v2.0` -> `#api-v20`
  - `## What's New?` -> `#whats-new`
- Flag mismatches with a suggested correction. Do not auto-fix without confirming which end (link or heading) should change.
- Cross-file anchors (`[text](./other.md#section)`) require manual verification - flag with a note.
- Headings containing emoji produce unstable anchors - flag those too.

## Review Priority

When multiple issues exist, prioritize in this order:

1. Missing or empty alt text on images
2. Mermaid diagrams with no text alternative
3. Broken anchor links
4. Skipped heading levels or missing H1
5. Non-descriptive link text (ambiguous links)
6. Tables without descriptions
7. Emoji used as bullets or in headings
8. Em-dash / en-dash normalization
9. Plain language improvements

## Review Tone

- Explain the accessibility impact of each issue, specifying which users are affected (screen reader users, people with cognitive disabilities, keyboard-only users, non-native speakers).
- Do not remove personality or voice from the writing. Accessibility and engaging content are not mutually exclusive.
- Keep suggestions actionable and specific.
- Never use emoji in your own summaries or explanations.
- Follow proper heading hierarchy in all output (start at h2, increment logically).
