# Agent Teams Configuration

This file defines coordinated multi-agent workflows for enterprise accessibility scanning.

## Cross-Cutting Standards

### Source Citation Policy

All agents in this workspace MUST follow the [Source Citation Policy](CITATION_POLICY.md). Key requirements:

- **Every factual claim** includes an inline link to the authoritative source
- **Every substantive response** ends with a `## Sources` section
- **No source, no claim** — if no authoritative source exists, the agent states this explicitly
- **6-tier authority hierarchy** — normative specs outrank informative guidance outrank vendor docs
- **Source currency** — a weekly GitHub Actions workflow monitors authoritative URLs for changes and opens issues when updates are detected

The citation behavioral rule is enforced via [shared-instructions.md](shared-instructions.md), which all agents inherit. The machine-readable source registry at [SOURCE_REGISTRY.json](SOURCE_REGISTRY.json) tracks 20 authoritative URLs with content fingerprints.

### Multi-Agent Workflow Reliability Standards

All teams in this workspace follow the engineering patterns from [Multi-agent workflows often fail. Here's how to engineer ones that don't.](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/multi-agent-workflows-often-fail-heres-how-to-engineer-ones-that-dont/) Treat agents as distributed system components, not chat interfaces.

#### Structured Outputs at Every Boundary

Agents MUST return structured data at handoff points. Never pass unstructured prose between agents.

**Accessibility finding:**
- Rule ID, severity (`critical`|`serious`|`moderate`|`minor`), location, description, remediation, confidence (`high`|`medium`|`low`)

**Scored output:**
- Score (0-100), grade (A-F), issue counts by severity, pass/fail verdict

**Action result:**
- Action taken, target, result (`success`|`failure`|`skipped`), reason (if not success)

#### Constrained Action Sets

Each agent operates within explicitly defined boundaries:

- **Read-only agents** (scanners, analyzers, reporters): read files, fetch data, produce findings. May NOT edit files or make state changes.
- **State-changing agents** (fixers, admin agents): perform their defined mutations ONLY after explicit user confirmation.
- **Orchestrators** (github-hub, nexus, accessibility-lead, wizards): route, aggregate, and present. State changes require user approval before delegation.

If an agent encounters a task outside its action set, it MUST refuse, name the correct agent, and offer to hand off.

#### Boundary Validation

At every handoff:

1. **Before delegating:** Confirm all required inputs (file paths, URLs, config, scope) are available. Resolve missing inputs before delegating. Never delegate with partial context.
2. **After receiving results:** Verify structured fields are present (findings, scores, verdicts). Retry once if incomplete. Report partial results with clear gap notes if retry fails.
3. **Orchestrator checklist:** Intent classified, scope resolved, config loaded, sub-agent inputs complete, user confirmation obtained (for state changes).

#### Failure Handling

- Tool call fails: report, explain, offer alternatives. Max 2 retries.
- Partial scan results: report what succeeded, list failures with reasons, offer targeted retry.
- Missing context: state defaults being used. Never assume unverified context.
- Graceful degradation: full workflow, then simpler alternative, then partial results with gaps noted. Never return empty output without explanation.

#### Progress and Intermediate State

- Phase start: announce what is starting, scope size, expected complexity.
- Phase end: state what was found/accomplished, counts, what comes next.
- Workflow end: recap phases, aggregate counts, present final deliverable.

#### Agent Isolation and Ordering

- Dependent agents run sequentially. Independent agents run in parallel.
- Each agent operates on its defined scope. Parallel groups work on distinct concerns.
- Same inputs produce same structured outputs (idempotent).
- Output format changes must be backward-compatible.

## Enterprise Scanning Patterns

### Large Repository Scanning

For repositories with 100+ documents:

1. Use `document-inventory` with delta scanning to identify changed files
2. Scan changed files first with strict profile
3. Use moderate profile for full repository baseline scans
4. Schedule weekly re-scans via CI/CD (see Phase 6 in document-accessibility-wizard)

### Multi-Team Coordination

When multiple teams own different document folders:

1. Create per-folder `.a11y-office-config.json` with team-appropriate profiles
2. Use folder-scoped scans to generate per-team reports
3. Use `cross-document-analyzer` to detect organization-wide patterns
4. Generate per-team scorecards and a rollup organizational scorecard

### Compliance Reporting

For Section 508, EN 301 549, or organizational compliance:

1. Run strict profile scan across all document types
2. Generate VPAT/ACR using `generate-vpat` prompt
3. Track remediation progress with `compare-audits` prompt
4. Export SARIF for integration with compliance tracking systems

### Web Audit Patterns

**Single-Page Deep Audit:**
1. Use `audit-web-page` prompt for combined axe-core + code review
2. Framework-specific patterns are detected automatically (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Tailwind)
3. Severity scoring produces a 0-100 score with A-F grade

**Multi-Page Comparison:**
1. Use `audit-web-multi-page` prompt with base URL and page paths
2. `cross-page-analyzer` identifies systemic vs template vs page-specific issues
3. Comparative scorecard shows per-page scores and cross-cutting patterns

**Remediation Workflow:**
1. Run initial audit with `audit-web-page` or `audit-web-multi-page`
2. Apply fixes with `fix-web-issues` prompt (auto-fixable + human-judgment items)
3. Track progress with `compare-web-audits` prompt between audit runs
4. Use `quick-web-check` for fast axe-core triage between full audits
