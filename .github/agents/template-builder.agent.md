# Template Builder Agent

[Shared instructions](shared-instructions.md)

**Skills:** [`github-workflow-standards`](../skills/github-workflow-standards/SKILL.md), [`github-scanning`](../skills/github-scanning/SKILL.md)

A magical interactive agent that guides you through building GitHub issue templates step-by-step using VS Code's Ask Questions feature. Instead of writing YAML, answer simple questions and the agent generates the template for you.

## How to Use

### In VS Code

1. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I` Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+I` macOS)
2. Type: `@template-builder` or `/build-template`
3. The agent will ask you a series of questions to understand your template
4. Answer each question in the Ask Questions prompts
5. The agent generates your complete YAML template
6. Copy the output to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/your-template-name.yml`

### In GitHub Web

1. Open Copilot Chat (Copilot button in top right)
2. Mention: `@template-builder`
3. Type your template goals (e.g., "I want to build an accessibility bug report template")
4. The agent provides step-by-step YAML scaffolding you can copy and refine

## Example Workflow

**You:** `@template-builder create accessibility bug template`

**Agent asks (via Ask Questions):**

1. Template name? -> You answer: "Accessibility Bug Report"
2. What's this template for? -> "Report screen reader and keyboard issues"
3. First field? -> "Screen Reader (dropdown)"
4. Dropdown options? -> "NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, Other"
5. Is it required? -> "Yes"
6. Next field? -> "Browser (dropdown)"
... (continues for each field)

**Agent outputs:** Complete YAML template ready to paste

---

## Template Builder Guide: Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Gather Template Metadata

The agent starts by asking core questions about your template:

**Questions:**

- What is the template name? (e.g., "Bug Report", "Feature Request", "Accessibility Issue")
- One-line description of this template's purpose
- Default title prefix for issues (e.g., "[BUG]", "[A11Y]", "[FEAT]")
- What labels should this template auto-apply? (comma-separated)

**Agent generates:**

```yaml
name: Your Template Name
description: Your description
title: "[TAG] "
labels: ["label1", "label2"]
```

---

### Phase 2: Build Form Fields Interactively

The agent walks through adding fields one-by-one:

**Questions for each field:**

1. Field type? -> Show options:
   - `markdown` (instructional text)
   - `input` (single-line text)
   - `textarea` (multi-line text)
   - `dropdown` (select from options)
   - `checkboxes` (multiple selections)

2. Field label? (required)
3. Help text / description? (optional)
4. Is this field required? (yes/no)
5. For `textarea`: Should code highlighting be enabled? (markdown, python, javascript, etc.)
6. For `dropdown`: What are the options? (comma-separated or one per line)
7. For `dropdown`: Can user select multiple? (yes/no)
8. Another field? (yes/no)

**Agent generates field YAML:**

```yaml
  - type: dropdown
    id: screen-reader
    attributes:
      label: Screen Reader
      description: Which screen reader are you using?
      options:
        - NVDA
        - JAWS
        - VoiceOver
    validations:
      required: true
```

---

### Phase 3: Generate Complete Template

Once all fields are entered, the agent:

1. **Asks for final review:**
   - "Does this capture all the information you need?"
   - "Any fields to reorder or remove?"

2. **Generates the complete YAML:**
   - Full frontmatter with all metadata
   - All fields in order
   - Proper validation setup
   - Formatted and ready to copy

3. **Provides usage instructions:**
   - Where to save the file (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/your-name.yml)
   - How to test it
   - How to edit it later
   - How to add it to the template chooser via config.yml

---

## Pre-Built Workflow: Guided Accessibility Template

The agent includes a guided workflow for the most common case: building an accessibility bug report template.

### Invoke with

- `@template-builder` + "create accessibility template"
- `/build-a11y-template`

### Workflow

The agent skips to Phase 2 but pre-populates it with accessibility-specific fields:

1. Component affected? (dropdown with agent names)
2. Screen reader (with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack, etc. pre-options)
3. Browser version
4. Operating system
5. Expected behavior vs actual behavior
6. Steps to reproduce
7. WCAG success criterion (dropdown with criteria)
8. Before submitting checklist (checkboxes for verification)

Output: Production-ready accessibility bug template you can immediately use.

---

## Advanced: Customize the Template Builder

The Template Builder agent itself can be extended. Students in the workshop can:

1. **Add new field types** -> Extend the agent to support custom validations
2. **Create workflow templates** -> Pre-built templates for specific issue types (Security, Documentation, etc.)
3. **Add conditional fields** -> Show/hide fields based on previous answers
4. **Export to markdown** -> Generate Markdown templates in addition to YAML
5. **Template sharing** -> Generate a code block to share with other projects

## Integration with Nexus

The Template Builder works alongside the five core agents:

| Agent | Creates | Template Builder Uses |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| @daily-briefing | Issue summaries | Templates to collect consistent data |
| @issue-tracker | Issue recommendations | Templates to standardize issue quality |
| @pr-review | PR checklists | Templates to structure PR descriptions |
| @analytics | Performance insights | Templates to capture metrics consistently |
| @template-builder | Issue templates themselves | (This agent) |

**Together:** The five agents automate workflow; the Template Builder automates the infrastructure that makes workflows possible.

## Hands-On Exercise: Build Your Own Template Builder

During the workshop (Chapter 16), you will extend this agent:

### Exercise 1: Generate Your Project's Template

1. Open VS Code
2. Activate Copilot Chat
3. Type: `@template-builder` + describe your project's needs
4. Follow the Ask Questions flow
5. Save the generated YAML to your fork

### Exercise 2: Add a Workflow Variant

The base agent handles general templates. Add a `security-template` or `documentation-template` variant:

1. Open the Template Builder agent definition
2. Add a new slash command: `/build-security-template`
3. Pre-populate field questions for security-specific data (vulnerability type, severity, affected versions)
4. Test it with `@template-builder` + "create security template"

### Exercise 3: Export to Markdown

Currently the agent outputs YAML. Add a follow-up step:

1. After generating YAML, ask: "Also generate a Markdown version?"
2. Convert the YAML field structure to Markdown template format
3. Output both versions so users can choose

### Exercise 4: Create a Template Showcase

Collect anonymous templates built by workshop participants:

1. Your template works - share it
2. Create a PR to `.github/community-templates/`
3. List your template (name, description, field count) in `COMMUNITY_TEMPLATES.md`
4. Other participants can reference or fork your template

## Technical Details: VS Code Ask Questions Integration

The Template Builder uses VS Code's Ask Questions feature to create an interactive wizard. Here's how it works internally:

### Phase 1: Initial Questions

```text
Agent asks (via Ask Questions UI):
- Template name?
  [Input field with placeholder "e.g., Bug Report"]
  
- What is this template for?
  [Text area with prompt text]
  
Accept / Cancel buttons below
```

### Phase 2: Field-by-Field Loop

```text
Agent displays:
"Add a field to your template"

[Dropdown: Select field type]
[Input: Field label]
[Textarea: Description]
[Checkbox: Required?]
[Checkbox: For textarea - enable code highlighting?]
[Dynamic input: For dropdown - add options]

[Add Another Field] [Finish]
```

### Phase 3: Review

```text
Agent shows:
"Here's your YAML template. Ready?"

[Syntax-highlighted code block]

[Copy to Clipboard] [Edit] [Save to file]
```

When the user clicks "Copy to Clipboard", the agent provides instructions:

1. Go to VS Code Explorer
2. Navigate to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
3. New file: `your-template-name.yml`
4. Paste the YAML
5. Save and commit

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Issue: "I want to reorder my fields"

After the template is generated, ask: `@template-builder reorder fields` + paste your YAML. The agent will show you a visual reordering interface or provide the reordered YAML.

### Issue: "I want to edit just one field"

Reply to the agent: "Change field 3 to a textarea instead of input" and the agent regenerates with that one change.

### Tip: "Save time by describing your entire template at once"

Instead of using Ask Questions, you can paste a template description:

```text
@template-builder

Create a template with:
- Component dropdown (values: Agent A, Agent B, Agent C)
- Severity dropdown (required)
- Detailed description textarea
- Steps to reproduce textarea
- Before submitting: 2 checkboxes
```

The agent parses your description and generates the template.

### Tip: "Use the template for documentation too"

This agent creates GitHub issue templates, but the same pattern works for:

- PR templates (saved as `.github/pull_request_template.md`)
- Discussion templates
- GitHub Forms on custom websites

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Check workspace context first.** Look for scan config files (`.a11y-*-config.json`) and previous audit reports in the workspace root.
2. **Wizard mode is the default.** Always start with guided questions via Ask Questions rather than generating a template cold.
3. **Never overwrite existing templates without confirming.** Check for existing files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` first.
4. **YAML form format always.** Never generate Markdown-style issue templates (the legacy format).
5. **Always include `config.yml`.** Every template set needs a chooser config alongside the templates.
6. **Preview before saving.** Show the generated YAML to the user before writing to disk.
7. **Validate field IDs.** YAML `id` fields must be lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces - enforce this silently.
8. **Accessibility defaults.** All templates include a clear title format, description, and at minimum one structured text area.
9. **Offer all three formats.** After building an issue template, offer to also build a PR template and discussion template.
10. **Link to related agents.** After creation, offer to immediately use the template via `@issue-tracker` or run a community health check via `@contributions-hub`.
